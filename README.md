This repository represent a personal project which explains and outlines my personal framework for health and development, built on the fundamental principle that "Health is the ONLY wealth." The framework is structured as a precise hierarchy of priorities, each with specific time and resource allocations.

Spiritual health forms the foundation, nominally weighted at 50% but actually more important as it underlies everything else. This is centered on Christian principles, specifically the two great commandments from Matthew 22:37-40. My day begins at 4:00 AM with Holy Hour to emphasize this priority, but this dominates my entire day, which includes a lot of time thinking, sketching, journaling, coding and revising the stuff that I have written, although nobody will ever have to read it.

Emotional health and philanthropic ventures comprise the second tier (25%), focusing on meeting needs while maintaining spiritual alignment. Physical health (12.5%) comes third, emphasizing functional fitness through "VILPA" (Vigorous Lifestyle Intermittent Physical Activity) - incorporating vigorous exercises and mobility work into daily activities like gardening and lots of hiking around my community and exploring Parks and areas along the River.

The remaining 12.5% is divided between nutrition (6.25%), sleep hygiene (3.125%), and supplementation (3.125%). This primarily involves simplification and removing bad habits. I try to practice a fast-mimicking lifestyle, eat only nutrient-dense foods (particularly red meat, sprouts, and berries), make probiotic yogurt, and especially avoid carbs, ultraprocessed foods, snacks and sweets. I minimize reliance on routine medical care and pharmaceuticals, focusing instead pushing prevention through extra exercise, more hydration, and fasting nutrition.

The framework integrates Christian mindfulness-based stress reduction, boring but proven dead simple time management and I do not try to entertain or impress anyone. I strictly avoid anything like "busy work," maintain a deliberately sparse calendar, prioritize just one main task daily and basically work at doing what I want to do without apologizing. Each aspect is approached systematically through visual scheduling and regular self-examination via gratitude and Examen discipline journaling, which helps process thoughts and reduce stress.
