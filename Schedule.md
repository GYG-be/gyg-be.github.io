These WEEKLY and DAILY schedule boilerplates are starting point; they are adapted as needed per the [Questions](https://markbruns.github.io/Questions) that I ask myself during my WEEKLY and DAILY time mgmt planning rituals, but the boilerplate schedule gives me something to start with. 

Each schedule boiler attempts to integrate all 26 [objectives](https://markbruns.github.io/Objectives) while creating a sustainable rhythm that balances spiritual growth, physical stewardship, relationships, productivity, service, fortitude, and rest. The flow moves from foundation to application to reflection throughout the week.

## DAILY Spiritual Focus Schedule

This only approximately what a day should look like, each day is different.

A good day STARTS with 9 hours of high quality sleep OR 8 hours sleeping with 30 minutes of waking up, 30 minutes of getting ready for sleep ... then 15 hours of waking time. If you cannot get 9 hours of time for winddown-sleep-wakeup, it's because you are not really efficiently using your 15 hours of full waking time.

The 15 hours of waking time should be timeblocked into thirty 30-minute time blocks ... even if some of those time blocks are blocked off to just go for a walk in the park and think.

Each 30 minute time-block should be made up of a 25-minute Pomodoro of FOCUSED work [in which one sits on a cheep inflatable stability ball and FOCUSES on work but NEVER just sits comfortably, NEVER lounging on any kind of chair or recliner], followed by a 30s re-group, followed by , a 4-minute HIIT snack of heavy bag hitting or weightlifting or a 4-minute Mobility WOD, followed by a 30s re-group ... that it ... all day long:
