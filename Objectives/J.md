## J. Covenant Relationships

"Kingdom" is a loaded word, we owe it to ourselves to think about what this word means and exactly how this agreement drives our service. Cultivating Christ-centered relationships marked by mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to biblical values. This involves prioritizing quality time with loved ones, practicing active listening and empathy, and offering forgiveness and grace in times of conflict. It also means surrounding oneself with godly influences and seeking accountability from fellow believers. This intentional approach to relationships fosters an environment of love, support, and spiritual growth.
