## V. Family/Friendship Priesthood or Spiritual Leadership

Leading one's family and close relationships with spiritual intentionality, fostering an environment of faith and discipleship. This involves prioritizing family devotions, praying together, and studying God's Word as a household. It also means modeling Christ-like love and character, offering guidance and support, and creating opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship. This commitment to spiritual leadership reflects a deep understanding of the importance of family and the role it plays in God's Kingdom.
