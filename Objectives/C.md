## C. Servant Leadership

Serve first! Serve first to imitate and fully adore the mysteries of Christ's example of servant leadership. In this case, we can lead best by following Christ's example. Prioritize the needs of others and using personal influence to empower and uplift those around you. This involves actively seeking opportunities to serve in the church, community, and workplace, while demonstrating humility, compassion, and a genuine desire to help others grow and succeed. It also means fostering healthy relationships built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to serving God and others.
