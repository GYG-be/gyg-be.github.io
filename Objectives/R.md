## R. Spiritual Fortitude

Developing resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity, trusting in God's strength and faithfulness. This involves cultivating a strong prayer life, immersing oneself in Scripture, and seeking support from fellow believers. It also means learning from trials, recognizing God's hand in difficult circumstances, and choosing to trust Him even when circumstances are uncertain. This steadfast faith reflects a deep understanding of God's sovereignty and a commitment to follow Him regardless of the cost.
