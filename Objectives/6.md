## 6th WHY -- Endocrinological Health, Deficiencies, Biochemical Imbalances and Supplementation

We don't ignore this, but we don't look here first ... 50% of our energy/focus goest to first priority, 25% energy/focus goes to second priority, 12.5% to third priority, 6.25% to fourth priority, 3.125% to fifth priority and 1.5625% to this priority ... if we have 112 hrs/week to spend on health, we spend 56 hrs on first priority, 28 hrs on second priority, 14 hrs on third priority, 7 hrs on fourth priority, 3.5 hrs on fifth priority [in addition to the 56 hrs we spend sleeping] and 3.5 hrs hrs/week on this priority. 

We spend 210 minutes/week on this priority ... that's 30 minutes/day ... that's GREAT PLENTY, when it comes to swallowing pills or deciding which pills to swallow ... but it's also sort of a catch-all for odds and ends that don't fit into the other five priorities.

Generally, we don't try to swallow our way to better health ... we correct the root cause ... so other things like failing to get a proper diet or enough exercise are higher priorities.

We not only avoid most supplements, but we also generally avoid time wasted on trying to figure out supplements; just use the Masterjohn's MasterClass, except that we use the cliffnotes version ... when in doubt drink more filtered water.

There's maybe some reason to take magnesium citrate and zinc ... and vitamin D, but it's better to get more sun ... use iodine woundspray rather liberally.

We might take an aspirin, but seldom ever need one ... we strongly AVOID routine use of medications like the plague ... this does not mean that we NEVER take prescription medications ... but it does mean that we never ROUTINELY take any form of medication over an extended period of time.

We are not absolutely averse to using supplements, but we are averse to using them as a crutch ... we are STRONGLY averse to a supplement-first approach to health.
