## H. Eternal Investment

This is the Grand Legacy, lasting far longer and taking  precedence over all earthly human legacies lasting hundreds or thousands of years. It's beyond human-scale comprehension. Building a LASTING permanent legacy by investing in the lives of others beyond my comprehension and representing lives that will not be born for hundreds or thousands of years is what contributing to the advancement of God's *heavenly* Kingdom is about ... we should not see these contributions to advancement of this realm as a future, post-self thing ... eternity starts with NOW, not something to put off. This involves actively discipling and mentoring younger believers, supporting missionary work and other Kingdom initiatives, and using personal resources to further the Gospel. This focus on eternal rewards reflects a deep understanding of the temporal nature of earthly life and a desire to store up treasures in Heaven.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Understanding Eternal Perspective

1. **How does my current understanding of "eternity" shape my daily decisions and priorities?** Since this is beyond human-scale comprehension, how is even thinking that would be labeled "grandiose" possibly grand enough? [1 John 2:17:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-17.html) *In all likelihood, as many theoretical physicists now realize the Universe and all laws governing the Universe, including possibly how Gravity is the mother of Time, might be temporary. The world is certainly temporary for each person, since one of our only certainties is that every person dies. The physical Earth itself is also temporary, since our Creator will instantiate a new Earth as Christians know from [Revelation 21—22](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-22.html). As a result, the desires of this world are certainly temporary. Wise people resist these temporary, evil desires, following the example of Jesus.* [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-peter/3/2-peter-3-8.html) *God is not bound by counting days from a human perspective. Time does not hold Him. He does not wait or rush in the same sense that mere humans do, locked as we are into minutes and hours and months. What seems like poor timing to us, as limited people, has a plan and purpose known only to God.*

2. **What Scripture passages most powerfully reframe my temporal perspective toward eternity?** [Ecclesiastes 3:11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-11.html) *God has placed eternity in the human heart, yet we cannot fully comprehend the scope of His divine plan. This tension between awareness of eternity and limitation in understanding it shapes our perspective. Solomon reflects on how God has designed humans with a unique capacity to contemplate eternity while still being bound by time, creating in us a longing that only eternal things can satisfy.* [Colossians 3:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-2.html) *Paul urges believers to set their minds on things above, not on earthly things. This radical reorientation of thought redirects our perspective from temporal concerns to eternal values, shifting how we evaluate what truly matters.*

3. **How might I better comprehend the vast difference between even thousands of years and eternity?** [Psalm 90:4:](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/90/Psalm-90-4.html) *In God's sight, a thousand years pass like a day or a few hours in the night watch. This psalm, attributed to Moses, provides one of the most profound contrasts between human time-bound experience and God's eternal nature. It reminds us that what seems lengthy to us is but a moment to God, highlighting the vast gulf between our temporal existence and God's eternal being.* [Isaiah 40:28:](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-28.html) *The Creator of the ends of the earth neither faints nor grows weary; His understanding is unsearchable. Isaiah reminds us that God exists outside time's constraints and His perspective encompasses all of history simultaneously, a concept that helps us grasp the limitations of our temporal thinking.*

4. **What cultural narratives about legacy and impact most influence my thinking, and how do they align with Scripture?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus contrasts storing treasures on earth versus heaven, directly challenging cultural notions of legacy based on material accumulation or worldly recognition. This passage confronts our desire to leave a visible, temporal mark by redirecting our attention to lasting spiritual investments that transcend cultural definitions of success.* [Proverbs 13:22:](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/13/Proverbs-13-22.html) *A good person leaves an inheritance to their children's children. Scripture affirms the value of generational thinking but defines true inheritance more broadly than mere financial assets, encompassing spiritual legacy, wisdom, and faith passed to future generations.*

5. **How do I reconcile living fully in the present moment while investing for eternal impact?** [Matthew 6:33-34:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html) *Jesus instructs us to seek first God's kingdom and righteousness while not worrying about tomorrow. This profound teaching bridges the tension between present faithfulness and future focus, showing that kingdom priorities in the present moment are precisely what create eternal impact.* [Ephesians 5:15-17:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-15.html) *Paul calls believers to make the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. This urgency about wisely using our present moments reflects an eternal perspective that values each day as an opportunity for kingdom investment.*

6. **What does it mean that "eternity starts with NOW," and how does this change my approach to today?** [John 17:3:](https://www.bibleref.com/John/17/John-17-3.html) *Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He sent. This revolutionary definition frames eternal life not primarily as endless duration but as a quality of relationship with God that begins the moment we know Him. This transforms our understanding of eternity from something exclusively future to a present reality we begin participating in now.* [2 Corinthians 4:16-18:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/4/2-Corinthians-4-16.html) *Paul contrasts our momentary troubles with eternal glory, teaching us to fix our eyes on what is unseen rather than what is seen. This perspective helps us recognize how our present circumstances connect to eternal outcomes, changing how we evaluate daily experiences.*

7. **How does my understanding of Heaven influence my earthly investments?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus teaches that where our treasure is, there our heart will be also. This fundamental principle connects our material investments to our spiritual priorities, suggesting that how we allocate resources reveals what we truly value and believe about eternal reality.* [Hebrews 11:13-16:](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-13.html) *The heroes of faith acknowledged they were strangers and exiles on earth, seeking a better country—a heavenly one. Their example shows how heavenly citizenship should shape earthly decisions, causing us to hold temporal possessions loosely while investing in what lasts.*

8. **What eternal realities am I most prone to forget when making decisions?** [2 Corinthians 5:10:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/5/2-Corinthians-5-10.html) *Everyone must appear before Christ's judgment seat to receive what is due for things done in the body. This sobering reality of future accountability for present choices is easily forgotten in daily decision-making but provides crucial perspective on the eternal significance of seemingly small choices.* [Romans 14:10-12:](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/14/Romans-14-10.html) *Each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. Paul reminds believers that our choices and judgments will ultimately be evaluated by God, not by human standards, a truth that should inform our decision-making process.*

9. **How do I distinguish between good long-term thinking and truly eternal thinking?** [Luke 12:16-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-16.html) *In Jesus' parable of the rich fool, a man makes excellent long-term financial plans but is called a fool because he is not rich toward God. This parable powerfully distinguishes between prudent temporal planning and genuine eternal wisdom, showing how seemingly wise strategies can ultimately prove foolish if they neglect spiritual reality.* [1 Timothy 6:17-19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-17.html) *Paul instructs the wealthy to be generous and willing to share, thus laying up treasure as a firm foundation for the coming age. This guidance helps distinguish between wise long-term financial thinking and truly eternal investment strategies.*

10. **What mental practices help me maintain an eternal perspective in temporal circumstances?** [Philippians 4:8:](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-8.html) *Paul directs believers to think about whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy. This discipline of focused thought helps maintain eternal perspective amid temporal distractions by training our minds on transcendent values.* [Romans 12:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html) *Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. This fundamental mental practice involves actively resisting worldly thought patterns while pursuing mental transformation through Scripture and the Holy Spirit's work.*

### Treasures in Heaven
11. **What does Jesus mean when He speaks of "storing up treasures in Heaven" in practical terms?** [Matthew 6:19-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) *Jesus contrasts earthly treasures that deteriorate with heavenly treasures that endure. While Jesus doesn't exhaustively define heavenly treasures, the broader context of His teachings suggests they include acts of obedience, generosity, self-sacrifice, and spiritual investments that have eternal significance rather than merely temporal value.* [Luke 12:33-34:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-33.html) *Jesus connects selling possessions and giving to the poor with providing purses that will not wear out and treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted. This practical example shows how redirecting material resources toward kingdom purposes constitutes storing heavenly treasure.*

12. **How do I currently measure eternal return on investment versus worldly returns?** [Mark 8:36:](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/8/Mark-8-36.html) *Jesus asks what profit there is in gaining the whole world yet forfeiting one's soul. This profound question establishes the ultimate measure of return on investment—the eternal destiny of human souls, including our own—against which all worldly gains must be evaluated.* [Galatians 6:7-9:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html) *Paul explains the principle of sowing and reaping, noting that sowing to please the Spirit yields eternal life. This agricultural metaphor provides a framework for evaluating investments based on their ultimate harvest, distinguishing between temporary and eternal returns.*

13. **What specific actions or decisions might constitute "storing treasures in Heaven" in my context?** [Matthew 25:34-40:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-34.html) *Jesus identifies caring for the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and imprisoned as actions with eternal significance. This teaching clarifies that meeting physical needs as an expression of love for Christ has eternal value.* [1 Timothy 6:17-19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/6/1-Timothy-6-17.html) *Paul instructs the wealthy to be rich in good deeds, generous and willing to share, thereby laying up treasure as a firm foundation for the coming age. These actions provide concrete examples of storing heavenly treasure through earthly resources.*

14. **How do I balance wise earthly stewardship with kingdom-focused investing?** [Matthew 25:14-30:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-14.html) *In the parable of the talents, Jesus affirms productive management of resources while emphasizing accountability to the Master. This teaching demonstrates that wise stewardship and kingdom-focus are complementary rather than contradictory, as faithful management ultimately serves kingdom purposes.* [1 Corinthians 4:2:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/4/1-Corinthians-4-2.html) *Those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. Paul emphasizes that Christian stewardship is fundamentally about faithfulness to God's purposes rather than maximizing returns by worldly standards.*

15. **What eternal treasures am I most motivated to pursue, and why?** [Philippians 3:7-11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-7.html) *Paul considers everything a loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ. This passionate declaration reveals Paul's highest treasure—intimate knowledge of Jesus—which motivated his entire ministry and provides a model for our own eternal pursuits.* [Revelation 4:10-11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/4/Revelation-4-10.html) *The twenty-four elders cast their crowns before God's throne, declaring Him worthy of glory and honor. This heavenly scene suggests that the opportunity to worship and glorify God constitutes the highest treasure of eternity.*

16. **How might the concept of "rewards in Heaven" influence my earthly choices without becoming mercenary?** [1 Corinthians 3:10-15:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-10.html) *Paul describes how each person's work will be tested by fire, with lasting work rewarded. This teaching frames heavenly rewards not as mercenary compensation but as the natural fruit of faithful service, encouraging quality and integrity in all we do.* [Hebrews 11:24-26:](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11-24.html) *Moses chose mistreatment with God's people over the treasures of Egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward. This example shows how eternal reward-consciousness can inspire sacrifice and faithful endurance rather than self-serving calculation.*

17. **What does Scripture reveal about the nature and substance of eternal rewards?** [2 Timothy 4:8:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-8.html) *Paul anticipates the crown of righteousness awarded by the righteous Judge to all who have longed for Christ's appearing. This reference to crowns suggests honor and recognition as aspects of heavenly rewards.* [Revelation 2:7, 10, 17, 26-28:](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/2/Revelation-2-7.html) *Christ promises various rewards to those who overcome, including access to the tree of life, the crown of life, hidden manna, a white stone with a new name, and authority over nations. These promises provide glimpses into the diverse and meaningful nature of eternal rewards.*

18. **How do I avoid turning eternal investment into a transaction or mere exchange?** [Luke 17:7-10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/17/Luke-17-7.html) *Jesus teaches that servants who have done everything commanded should consider themselves unworthy servants who have only done their duty. This perspective counters transactional thinking by emphasizing that our service to God flows from duty and relationship rather than calculation of benefits.* [1 John 4:19:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html) *We love because He first loved us. This foundational principle reframes all spiritual investment as response to grace rather than transaction, grounding our motives in gratitude rather than self-interest.*

19. **What investments of time, talent, and treasure might yield the greatest eternal returns?** [Matthew 28:18-20:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/28/Matthew-28-18.html) *Jesus commands making disciples of all nations. This Great Commission indicates that investments in evangelism and discipleship yield enormous eternal returns by expanding God's kingdom and transforming lives.* [Galatians 5:22-23:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) *The fruit of the Spirit represents lasting character qualities with eternal significance. Investing in spiritual formation produces character aligned with God's nature, constituting returns that transcend temporal circumstances.*

20. **How might my understanding of God's grace inform my pursuit of eternal treasures?** [Ephesians 2:8-10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html) *We are saved by grace through faith for good works prepared in advance for us to do. This comprehensive statement places grace as the foundation for all eternal pursuits, framing good works as response to salvation rather than means of earning it.* [Titus 2:11-14:](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-11.html) *God's grace teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives. This passage shows how grace motivates and empowers our pursuit of eternal values rather than opposing effort.*

This pattern of multi-generational spiritual investment creates an exponential legacy of faith transmission that each believer is called to continue.* [1 Corinthians 11:1:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/11/1-Corinthians-11-1.html) *Paul invites others to follow his example as he follows Christ's example. This transparent invitation to imitation demonstrates how personal example becomes a powerful form of legacy that others can extend.*

22. **What unique wisdom or experience do I have that should be intentionally passed on?** [Psalm 78:2-4:](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/78/Psalm-78-2.html) *The psalmist commits to teaching the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, His power, and the wonders He has done. This passage emphasizes our responsibility to pass on not just information but testimony of God's work in our lives and history.* [Deuteronomy 6:6-7:](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-6.html) *Moses commands Israel to impress God's commandments on their children, talking about them in all daily contexts. This comprehensive approach to transmission suggests wisdom should be woven into everyday conversations and experiences rather than isolated to formal teaching moments.*

23. **How do I identify those whom I should be actively discipling or mentoring?** [Matthew 9:36-38:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/9/Matthew-9-36.html) *Jesus sees the crowds as harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd, and tells disciples to pray for workers for the harvest. This compassionate vision for humanity suggests we should identify discipleship candidates based on spiritual need rather than merely affinity or convenience.* [Acts 16:1-3:](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-1.html) *Paul meets Timothy, who was well spoken of by believers, and decides to take him along on his journey.

87. **What practices help me view difficult people through an eternal lens?** [Colossians 3:12-14:](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html) *Paul instructs believers to clothe themselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, and forgiveness. These virtues form practical responses to difficult people that reflect eternal values rather than natural reactions.* [Matthew 7:1-5:](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-1.html) *Jesus warns against judging others while ignoring our own faults. This teaching reframes difficult relationships through self-examination and humility, recognizing our common need for grace rather than focusing on others' failings.*

This multi-generational transmission strategy creates lasting impact through spiritual multiplication rather than relying solely on personal influence.* [Titus 2:3-5:](https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/2/Titus-2-3.html) *Paul directs older women to train younger women in godliness. This intergenerational mentoring approach creates successive waves of influence that continue long after initial investments through ongoing replication of wisdom and character.*

90. **How might I better love the actual people in my life rather than abstract future generations?** [1 John 4:20-21:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-20.html) *John challenges that anyone claiming to love God while hating a brother or sister is lying, as we cannot love God whom we haven't seen while failing to love those we have seen. This pointed instruction prioritizes tangible love for present relationships over abstract spiritual ideals.* [Galatians 6:10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-10.html) *As we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

### Legacy and Memory
91. **What eternal truth do I most want to be remembered for transmitting?** [1 Corinthians 15:3-4:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/15/1-Corinthians-15-3.html) *Paul identifies what he received as of first importance: Christ died for our sins, was buried, and was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.

This intergenerational transmission practice extends influence far beyond personal connections or recognition.* [2 Timothy 3:16-17:](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html) *All Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.

98. **How do I distinguish between ego-driven legacy and kingdom-advancing influence?** [Luke 14:7-11:](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/14/Luke-14-7.html) *Jesus teaches taking the lowest place rather than seeking honor, concluding that those who exalt themselves will be humbled and vice versa. This principle helps distinguish ego-driven status-seeking from humble kingdom service through examining motivations and approach.* [Galatians 1:10:](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-10.html) *Paul asks if he is trying to win human approval or God's approval, declaring that if he were still trying to please people, he would not be Christ's servant.

100. **What single investment of my remaining time on earth might yield the most significant eternal returns?** [1 John 2:17:](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/2/1-John-2-17.html) *In all likelihood, as many theoretical physicists now realize the Universe and all laws governing the Universe, including possibly how Gravity is the mother of Time, might be temporary. The world is certainly temporary for each person, since one of our only certainties is that every person dies. The physical Earth itself is also temporary, since our Creator will instantiate a new Earth as Christians know from [Revelation 21—22](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-22.html). As a result, the desires of this world are certainly temporary. Wise people resist these temporary, evil desires, following the example of Jesus.* [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-peter/3/2-peter-3-8.html) *God is not bound by counting days from a human perspective. Time does not hold Him. He does not wait or rush in the same sense that mere humans do, locked as we are into minutes and hours and months. What seems like poor timing to us, as limited people, has a plan and purpose known only to God.*
