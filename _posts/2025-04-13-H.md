## H. Eternal Investment

This is the Grand Legacy, lasting far longer and taking  precedence over all earthly human legacies lasting hundreds or thousands of years. It's beyond human-scale comprehension. Building a LASTING permanent legacy by investing in the lives of others beyond my comprehension and representing lives that will not be born for hundreds or thousands of years is what contributing to the advancement of God's *heavenly* Kingdom is about ... we should not see these contributions to advancement of this realm as a future, post-self thing ... eternity starts with NOW, not something to put off. This involves actively discipling and mentoring younger believers, supporting missionary work and other Kingdom initiatives, and using personal resources to further the Gospel. This focus on eternal rewards reflects a deep understanding of the temporal nature of earthly life and a desire to store up treasures in Heaven.
