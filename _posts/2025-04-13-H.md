## H. Eternal Investment

Building a lasting legacy by investing in the lives of others and contributing to the advancement of God's Kingdom ... we should not see these contributions to advancement of this realm as a future, post-self thing ... eternity starts with NOW, not something to put off. This involves actively discipling and mentoring younger believers, supporting missionary work and other Kingdom initiatives, and using personal resources to further the Gospel. This focus on eternal rewards reflects a deep understanding of the temporal nature of earthly life and a desire to store up treasures in Heaven.
