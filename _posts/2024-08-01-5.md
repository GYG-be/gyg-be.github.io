## 5th WHY -- Maintain Or Improve Brain Health with MBSR Stress Mgmt, Sleep And Immersive Learning

50% of our energy/focus goest to first priority, 25% energy/focus goes to second priority, 12.5% to third priority, 6.25% to fourth priority, 3.125% to this fifth priority and 1.5625% to the sixth priority ... if we have 112 hrs/week to spend on health, we spend 56 hrs on first priority, 28 hrs on second priority, 14 hrs on third priority, 7 hrs on fourth priority, 1.75 hrs/week on the sixth priority ... 3.5 hrs on this sleep or brain health priority [in addition to the 56 hrs we spend sleeping]. 

We spend 210 minutes/week on this priority ... that's 30 minutes/day doing MBSR and sleep hygiene optimization ... that's might not seem like enough, but we also do MBSR in other areas.

IMMERSION is about studying the ***right*** way to do the ***RIGHT*** thing at the ***RIGHT*** time ...there's only one time of day to SLEEP ... if we want to get serious about sleep hygiene, we probably need to get serious about why we are NOT able to sleep, ie active, healthy, fit people generally don't have problems sleeping ... that usually means responding to stress on our schedule, according to our agenda to get at the root cause of the stress, rather than involuntarily reacting to stressors at all hours of the day ... this is sleep hygience might seem kind of simple, whereas [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction) requires some conscious effort and diligence.
