# The Essence of Creativity is Creating ... Begin By Creating Yourself ... First, Create Your DAY

You have a Creator who created you in that Creator's image ... LOVE your Creator by doing the best job that you can to create yourself ... that's a HUGE enough challenge, so FIRST just work on CREATING your DAY.

Our lives and everything around us is an example of the unfolding of a devastatingly SIMPLE set of natural laws, but laws which indicate a much grander, more comprehensive planning process ... we LISTEN to God in order to study and learn from this approach to planning process ... that's why ... ***during Holy Hour, WE LISTEN, we adore, we submit our will in front of a much greater power ... we don't dictate to God, cast spells or utter special incantations or beg that our needs/wants are met***.

**In order to create ... LISTEN to your Creator!**

Start your DAY off at 4 AM with Holy HOUR ... pray that the WILL of your Creator be done ... pray that you be given the guideance, serendipitous awareness and opportunities so that you might do your designated part to serve that will ... this is entirely about HUMILITY first, not about your needs/wants OR the needs/wants of any other human being. You were brought into existence so that you might have a more full life and through the grace of the God lead an exemplary life in a manner that spreads adundance for others.

AFTER you have started off correctly with HOLY HOUR ... in the five peak hours, timeblock and prioritize the 10 big things that you need to do today ... that should leave you with approximately 10 hours of purely creative time ... during the times, when you are taking a break from putting a dent in the hard, necessary things that you might not otherwise do unless you've timeblocked slot for them ... work CREATIVELY on your your writing, your reading, your code and the art of being YOU ... the **important thing is to renounce everything else** that doesn't HAVE TO BE DONE or is not a creative pursuit.

# Don't Worry, As Long As You Keep The Channel Open [Through Prayer] Your Creator Will Keep You On Track

HOLY HOUR is supremely important for creating your day.

Whether you accept it or not, it doesn't matter ... fake your acceptance and try to act as if you accept it until you do accept it.

The very fact of your existence is the evidence that your existence is part of the larger creative flow of your Creator ... but it can matter to you, but only if you develop a constant prayerful relationship with your Creator ... and we should never forget that this is a matter of submission and listening rather than a matter of commanding or begging/receiving. 

It's important for us as Christians to understand that Jesus was very explicit in distinguishing his approach from that of a thief or tax collector ... [Jesus Christ is about ABUNDANCE](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/john/10-10.htm). It is important to UNDERSTAND that the parables about the miracles of loaves and fishes is about ABUNDANCE ... the parable is not about begging or devising a fundraising scheme or collecting money from well-heeled, but guilt-addled contributors in order to finance a poverty mission outside of the good part of town ... the MOST disgusting, most pathetic humans are the affluent and those collect taxes and dues from the affluent, so that the affluent never have to hang out with the poor, the disgraced or the lepers. 

Jesus is not about the collection plate or [**vigorish**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish) or *וויגריש* or *vigrish* or ***vig***. The ***Vigorish***, also known as *juice*, or *under-juice, the cut, the take, the margin, the house edge* or just the vig is the fee or commission charged by a bookmaker for accepting a gambler's wager; it can also refer to the interest owed a loanshark for each period, eg per week, in consideration for credit ... taxation is theft; the vigorish is theft -- Jesus Christ doesn't ***take a cut*** ... *that's what churches do.*

***UNDERSTAND the difference*** between Jesus Christ and those people or organizations expecting a cut or a tithe or standard minimal baseline amount are operating on the same principle as thieves, tax collectors, bookies or loan sharks.

## BE Stronger, more courageous, less afraid

This whole existence is all about [Joshua 1.9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/1-9-compare.html) ... things are already set in motion, you have been commanded and you should choose to be as courageous as possible, ie it's okay to be damned afraid and kind of scared out of your wits -- so it's just fine to fake to courage even when you can't exactly be filled with as much courageous as you would like.

This whole existence is about the creative flow of BECOMING ... examples abound around us for how the greater CREATION is unfolding ... as if by an INVISIBLE HAND guiding many different players ... consider the example of the evolution in information technology from client-server based things like ERP, intranets and company email servers in the 1990s ... to cloud-based web services and VPNs in the 2000s ... to full-blown SaaS and compelling SaaS integrations across different SaaS platforms for much, MUCH more affordable systems with solid features in the 2010s which would have been out-of-reach to service subscribers and not even thought of by ERP systems, intranets and email servers ... to the 2020s with agentic AI workflows and hybrid AI-assisted customer support systems that are much more intelligent and responsive for providing ***genuinely helpful*** customer service that actually answers specific customer needs not just regurgitated answers from helpdesk FAQs ... so that today we can think about questions like "*How does [Sourcegraph Code Intelligence and Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/pricing) work at different levels?  What might autocomplete look like in IDE that I use to create my workflow? How can I use it to* **MORE INTELLIGENTLY** *go about the process of create my day?*"

This whole existence is about the creative flow of BECOMING ... that's WHY we get up in the morning to prayerfully submit during Holy Hour ... to discern what we should be working on next, to *remotely view* where our skills are needed most, to *SEE* where we might be of greater value and service to others.
