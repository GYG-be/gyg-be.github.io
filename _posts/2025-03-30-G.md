## G. Prioritize Stewardship Of Health

The BODY is the temple that matters; the physical body supports the MIND, the mind and body support the SOUL. Stop worrying about bricks/mortar or HVAC appliances or any other gear for either your abode or any kind of church building. Stop being addicted to physical comfort or convenience. Caring for the physical body as a sacred dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. This involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient rest. It also means avoiding harmful substances and behaviors that damage the body and hinder spiritual well-being. This commitment to physical health reflects a deep respect for God's creation and a desire to honor Him with one's body.
