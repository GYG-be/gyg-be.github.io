## G. Prioritize Stewardship Of Health

Without physical health, it is really impossible to make progress on anything else. The BODY is the temple that has to matter, starting wiht the physical body which supports the MIND and also informs our ability to build discipline and foster emotional health and build connections. In turn, discipline, emotions, our minds and our connections support the health of the SOUL, which is all that really matters. Comfort and convenience often undermine discipline and almost push us into addictions and worrying about how we are going to gaurantee our comfort and convenience. Prioritize development of your soul -- stop worrying about bricks/mortar or HVAC appliances or any other gear for either your abode or any kind of church building. It's one thing to appreciate nice things, but stop being addicted to physical comfort or convenience. Caring for and nurturing the physical body is the foundation of the beginnings of a sacred dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. This involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient rest. It also means avoiding harmful substances and behaviors that damage the body and hinder spiritual well-being. This commitment to physical health reflects a deep respect for God's creation and a desire to honor Him with one's body.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Foundation: Treating The Physical Body as A Holy Temple
1. How does my understanding of my body as a "temple of the Holy Spirit" which is not owned, but ***bought at a price*** ([1 Corinthians 6:19-20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-20.html)) influence my daily or moment-by-moment health decisions? Why should I bring anything into my body that does not support the larger spiritual agendas of the owner of my body, Jesus Christ?
2. In what ways do I currently IMPROVE how I honor God [or reduce the times when I dishonor Him] through my lack of stewardship of my physical body or mind? How do respond to God's mercy in terms of forgiveness and earnest prayer to repent and not repeat my mistakes. ([Romans 12:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html))
3. How might viewing my *body, mind and soul* as sacred, because they are owned by Jesus Christ, change my approach to health or fitness or discipline? ([1 Thessalonians 5:23](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-23.html)) Paul **reverses this order**, giving highest priority to the spirit and the lowest priority to the body. The spirit connects us to God and enables us to worship God and to fellowship with Him. The soul is the seat of emotions and makes us conscious of our being. The body connects us to our environment. We need to be kept faultless by God in our worship of Him and in our fellowship with Him. We need to be free of any legitimate accusation in our inner being and in our social relationships.
