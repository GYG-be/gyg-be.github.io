## P. Biblical Asset Stewardship

As Christians, particularly if we consider ourselves to be disciples of Christ, we directed to *[live in the world, but not be of it](https://versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/how-do-we-live-in-the-world-but-not-of-the-world)*. Managing finances and possessions responsibly, while renouncing comfort, convenience and any so-called "just reward" of efforts is about recognizing that all resources ultimately belong to God. This balancing act involves creating a budget, avoiding debt, and giving generously to support Kingdom work. It also means growing new businesses and generating wealth and using assets to bless others, care for the environment, and advance God's purposes in the world. This approach to stewardship reflects a heart of gratitude for God's provision and a desire to honor Him with all that He has entrusted.
