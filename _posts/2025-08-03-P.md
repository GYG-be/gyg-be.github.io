## P. Biblical Asset Stewardship

We are to *[live in the world, but not be of it](https://versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/how-do-we-live-in-the-world-but-not-of-the-world)*. Managing finances and possessions responsibly, while renouncing comfort, convenience and any so-called "just reward" of efforts is about recognizing that all resources ultimately belong to God. This involves creating a budget, avoiding debt, and giving generously to support Kingdom work. It also means using possessions to bless others, care for the environment, and advance God's purposes in the world. This approach to stewardship reflects a heart of gratitude for God's provision and a desire to honor Him with all that He has entrusted.
