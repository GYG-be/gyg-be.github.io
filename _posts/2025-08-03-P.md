## P. Biblical Asset Stewardship

As Christians, particularly if we consider ourselves to be disciples of Christ, we directed to *[live in the world, but not be of it](https://versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/how-do-we-live-in-the-world-but-not-of-the-world)*. Managing finances and possessions responsibly, while renouncing comfort, convenience and any so-called "just reward" of efforts is about recognizing that all resources ultimately belong to God. This balancing act involves creating a budget, avoiding debt, and giving generously to support Kingdom work. It also means growing new businesses and generating wealth and using assets to bless others, care for the environment, and advance God's purposes in the world. This approach to stewardship reflects a heart of gratitude for God's provision and a desire to honor Him with all that He has entrusted. 

# Two Example Questions With Scripture and Commentary To Illustrate Desired Format of Response

1. **How does Scripture's view of humans as integrated whole spiritual beings, but differ from the materialist modern perspectives?**

- [1 Thessalonians 5:23](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-23.html) - "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your WHOLE ***1)*** spirit, **2)** soul and *3)* body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." *Notice the order; the order tells us that the material perspective comes last OR, more accurately, is in service of or subject to the preceding priorities, ie body serves soul, soul and body serve spiritual essence.
- [Mark 12:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-30.html) - "Love **the Lord your God** with ***all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength***." We are to love our Creator, giving that love FIRST priority; we are to love all others as we love ourselves, but that is a SECOND priority. "Heart" is from the Greek root word kardia, and means the center of one's life, whether physical, spiritual, or mental. The heart drives one's beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and intentions. "Soul" is from the Greek root word psychÄ“ which is similar to the heart, but focuses on the vital force that keeps us alive. "Mind" is not found in the original Old Testament quote (Deuteronomy 6:5, see below), but is certainly appropriate to add for an audience influenced by more logical Greek culture. It comes from the Greek root word dianoia and, again, has a similar definition to heart but with a more mental bent.
- [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-5.html) - "Love **the LORD your God** with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." Verse like this show me why the Bible is so important to study, because of how it is about evolvution of culture and mindsets over 1000s of years. The fact that mind is not included here illustrates something about how the ancient saw life as primarily a matter of defined by heart and soul and strength; in other words, the human experience was not yet intellectual or dedicated to the mind or anything remotely similar to having a socratic or platonic or aristotelian or philosophic influence of any kind. The ancients were extremely simple, much less capable in many ways, but were much less neurotic, self-obsessed and meta-cognitive than we moderns are. At the time Deuteronomy was written, the concept of "mind" would have been almost unknown or perhaps, if it was known, seen as being "New Agey" or as futuristic speculative proto-Greek bs and and not to be trusted. The life of the mind has been a tremendous blessing to humanity. Our consumption of knowledge has defined how we think about developing ourselves, how we order and plan our lives and it has certainly given us the ability to think about abstract principles and thus solve problems that humans could not begin to even contemplate in an ancient world -- just as texts, priests, scriptures changed the minds and then lives and capabilities and ability to reason of the ancients, programattic knowledge we see in AI and knowledge engineering will similarly transform humans as we go forward, AS THE CREATOR CLEARLY INTENDED.

2. **What biblical examples demonstrate the ancient's better interconnection between spiritual, mental, and physical well-being?**

- [Proverbs 4:20-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-22.html) - "My son, pay attention to what I say; *turn your ear to my words* [ie, Solomon tells his son, to "do as I say, not as I do"]. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body." Discerning the WILL of the Creator, including for one's own time mgmt priorities, exercise, diet, sleep, sobriety, overall well-being, coming up with a plan and then consistently sticking with ***"the plan"*** is the way to avoid unnecessary, foreseeable disaster.
- [3 John 1:2](https://www.bibleref.com/3-John/1/3-John-1-2.html) - "***Beloved***, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul." The apostle John was quite old by the time he wrote this letter to his dear Christian friend Gaius who was of a similar age. "*As it goes well with your soul*" is a gentle reminder to Gaius, a contemporary of John's, who knew [but maybe needed a gentle reminder] that physical health, or one's ability to deal with severely declining physical health, derives from, or is of secondary importance to, spiritual health. The interconnections is definitely NOT a matter of equivalence or trade-offs; there is a priority to what must come first.
- [Psalm 103:1-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/103/Psalm-103-5.html) - "Praise the LORD, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name... who ***satisfies you with good*** so that your youth is renewed like the eagle 's." It's important to remember that "good" is something defined according to God's perfect wisdom (Isaiah 55:8), not ours. Everything God has created has a good purpose (1 Timothy 4:4), even if we cannot fully understand all things.
