## K. Open And Sharing Generosity

Embracing a lifestyle of generosity by sharing resources, knowledge, and skills to benefit others and advance God's Kingdom. This involves giving financially to support church ministries, missionary work, and those in need. It also means volunteering time and expertise to serve others, mentor younger believers, and contribute to the community. This spirit of generosity reflects a heart of gratitude for God's blessings and a desire to be a good steward of His resources.
