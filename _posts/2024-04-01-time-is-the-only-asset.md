At the bottom of this post, you will find our list of the 250 best time management hacks ... this doesn't mean that you shouldn't INVEST in something like an ICanStudy program from Dr. Justin Fung ... our list are just the kinds of things that you should think about.
# 86400 secs/day

USE every second ... well, sort of ... by USE, we mean don't squander ANY seconds doing things that don't help your soul ... but using every second means paying attention to sleep hygiene, following the early-to-bed/early-to-rise paradigm and getting a good nights rest ... and but it's also about HOLY HOUR starting at 4:00 AM and then spending one timeblock timeblocking the full day ... there are thirty 30-minute timeblocks in a 15 hour waking day ... the first two belong to HOLY HOUR ... the next one belongs to TIMEBLOCKING ... and then, at 5:30 the productive part of the day begins. 

USE at least 10 of your time blocks to do the kinds of stuff that you probably wouldn't otherwise do if you didn't schedule it or put it on your "GOTTA do that today" list ... do NOT make the mistakes of just staying busy all day ... you're only good for 10 30-minute blocks of peak attention, hightly focused work. Build in breaks as you are doing this.

USE at least 10 of those 30 minute timeblocks to challenging creative stuff that pushes you a bit, that others find useful and you really enjoy doing. As with the "GOTTA do that today" list, build in breaks as you are doing this ... you can shuffle in all three kinds of times, but breaks are essential.

When we are talking about breaks and breaktimes, that means USING at least 10 of those 30 minute timeblocks to do ORDINARY normal decent human stuff like checking up on friends/family, cooking, eating, going for a walk, spending some time in Nature, gardening or doing relaxing, but normal, ordinary stuff.

There's ZERO time for TV watching or drinking alcohol or doing any mindnumbing shit that just makes you stupider.

Do not JUST timeblock your day ... but USE your mind to constantly bring your focus back to the task at hand in that second. ***The notion that we can do anything WELL or SAFELY while we are multitasking is a complete lie.*** 

We do not JUST timeblock our days ... instead, we practice our discipline of USING your mind to constantly bring your focus back to the task at hand ... we USE our time more effectively, more efficiently, more completely by focusing on one task at hand ... and practicing that discipline of focus ALL DAY LONG with EVERY waking and EVERY sleeping second 

## STOP Thinking That Multitasking Helps You

*Of course, we THINK that we can multitask safely, but we really can't.* We can set things all kinds of things in motion, eg like making a pot of coffee while we fire up our computer, get out a folder or physical item while the computer fires up so that a few minutes later we can grab a cup of coffee ... but just because we can set things in motion all at once, it does not mean that we are doing things particularly WELL or, at all, SAFELY, eg we cannot be driving a car and texting at the same time. 

## EVERY second is for developing the discipline of FOCUS

In each second, we must continually bring our minds back to center ... back to the task at hand.

EACH second is for mindfully develop the discipline of FOCUSING.

Doing this EACH second that we work on ONE tasks helps solidify the mindfulness discipline throughout the day.

In that way, we can always be PRESENT, completely focused on the task at hand ... without really having to even think that much about it ... UNTIL we notice, that our mind is [once again] not just wandering, but *something* or *someone* is trying to train our minds to wander. 

As we go through life ... we want to change those *somethings* and *someones* from driving us to distraction or loss of focus ... if we cannot achieve that change, we will need to remove those those *somethings* and *someones* having access to our minds; MOSTLY, this means that we will want to work harder at removing the bad habits of being ourselves.

**MOSTLY, it's US!  We look at ourselves FIRST; because we are supposed to be in control of ourselves.** 

But in some cases, where the control is beyond anything that we can/should do, we will actually need to remove the influences of the bad habits of other things and other people from our lives.

## How we THINK about our own time and what we use it for is everything.

Everyone can ask themselves about their time mgmt discipline ... here’s a comprehensive starter list of 250 questions that can help one reflect on time management, values, goal setting, prioritization, sustainable productivity, and workflow optimization. 

This is ONLY a starter list ... you can review these questions and make them better by making YOUR set of 250 questions more applicable, to better spark your own deep thinking and actionable insights. 

There's NO MAGIC ... the big magic is from ditching the TV or the endless social media scrolling or the alcohol OR ANYTHING THAT'S MAKING YOU STUPIDER AND MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WORSE THAN STUPID. 

USE the questions to spark your own BETTER questions. Reflect, plan, and take actionable steps toward better time management, productivity, and personal growth ... use them as daily prompts for journaling, starting points for discussions with friends of the "What's your approach to ____?" or for strategic planning sessions in business, organizations or even marriage!
