# The World Need Less Longing For Supposedly Better Times In The Past

There has NEVER been better time to be alive for high-agency people ... and it's getting better all the time for high-agency people ... which is kind of remarkable because ANY point in history has been pretty great for anyone CHOOSING to be a high-agency person.

But LEGIT high-agency people compassionately, continuously work at pulling others to be higher-agency people ... this pulling up of the skills and competencies of others is what being a 10X-er is about ... the highest agency productive people are the ones who make those around them 10X more productive.

It's not just continuous improvement -- it has to be continuous improvement squared ... everybody pulling everyone else up.

I'm not exactly saying that the world needs less nostalgia ... well, okay, maybe, I am saying *something exactly like that* ... the world needs less longing for better times in the past. In other words, it needs MORE people to renounce being victims and instead to choose to be high-agency people.

People who want to choose to be high-agency people ... and it really IS as simple as CHOSING to be a high-agency person ... need to spend more time discerning their destiny and praying for the wisdom and guidance about what they are destined to create. They need to spend less time praying for some article, thing or relationship, eg a house, car, gadget, girlfriend or some sort of easy button, such as a magic wand to take them back to some set of golden years.
