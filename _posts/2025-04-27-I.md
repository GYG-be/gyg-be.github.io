## I. Kingdom Enterprise

We know that "Kingdom" is a very loaded word. We owe it to ourselves to think very carefully, very concretely about what this means and exactly Who/What is this King that serve. The words were chosen in order to make the message understandable for earlier ages, but those are not necessarily our Creator's words. They are only words that WERE chosen in the past to help humans as they tried to understand. Using entrepreneurial skills and resources to create businesses and ministries that honor God and serve others. This involves operating with integrity, pursuing excellence, and prioritizing ethical business practices. It also means using profits to support Kingdom work, create jobs, and contribute to the well-being of the community. This approach views business as a platform for ministry and seeks to integrate faith and work in a way that glorifies God.
