## M. Resurrected, Renewed, Enhanced Mind

Renewing the mind by embracing lifelong learning and seeking wisdom from God's Word. This involves actively engaging with Scripture, studying theological concepts, and applying biblical principles to daily life. It also means staying informed about current events and cultural trends, discerning truth from falsehood, and using knowledge to serve God and others. This commitment to intellectual growth reflects a desire to know God more deeply and to use one's mind for His glory.
