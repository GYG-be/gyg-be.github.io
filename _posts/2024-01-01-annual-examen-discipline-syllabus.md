# What Examen Discipline Is About

Examen Discipline is about consistently, sustaining an intensely introspective examinations of unproductive behaviors, not just bad habits but less than optimal habits, and various levels of addictions ... the daily journal is a bit of a wild, stream of conciousness journal ... but that's not the objective. The final objective or desired destination of an Examen journal is to review the material ... you gain insights through the process of making a syllabus of the recorded stream of consciousness discussion in your examen journal, especially as you refine your personal syllabus to make it clear and concise. It's difficult if not impossible to follow the past thought processes as you look a the journal in the future. Yes, it might spark other thoughts, but when the ideas are disjointed and unconnected, you will struggle to make sense of your own thoughts and the progress possible by examining your own life will escape you.

Originally, almost 500 years ago [in 1548] Examen Discipline was something for Jesuit novitiates based upon [St. Ignatious Loyola's (1491-1556)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola) compilation of [Spiritual Exercises](https://sacred-texts.com/chr/seil/index.htm). As the founder of the Jesuit order, Loyola's original plan was to use an intensive training *retreat,* held over the course of about a month rapidly develop discipline at the beginning of the first year training for those new Jesuit recruits. The Jesuit's quasi-military approach is a reflection of St. Ignatius Loyola, a soldier and combat veteran of the army of the Holy Roman Empire. If we understand something about Loyola's family and his approach to being a soldier, we will understand why his Spiritual Exercises would seem like something designed by a boot camp drill instructor to train spiritual warriors for the fiercest spiritual combat imaginable. 

However, one does not have to be a Jesuit-in-training to either read and take advantage of the Spiritual Exercises or to develop Examen Discipline over the course of one's life.  In fact, the Examen Discipline is something best developed and sustained over the course of years and ultimately decades rather than a crash course that lasts weeks or months. Increasingly, lay people and even non-Catholics follow the Examen path. The important part is the discipline is not exactly in the intensity of the training; rather, the important part is the sustained, long-term, daily discipline of consistently, persistently, and persistently examining your life and your habits.

For centuries, Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were most commonly given as a “long retreat” of about 30 days in solitude and silence, but in recent years, especially with better tools for the quantatized self, fitness/diet tracking and lessons learned by others through self-reflection, there has been a renewed, revitalized emphasis on Examen and the approach of the Spiritual Exercises as a program for laypeople. Although it is true that there are many aspects of modern life and our digital technology that can divert us from the Lord's path, it is also true those same technologies and social interactions can greatly enhance our ability to work on our discipline. It's just simply a matter of to what end the tools are applied.

Examen discipline is particularly appropriate for anyone interested in overcoming addictions, bad habits, and unproductive behaviors. When we talk about addictions, we are not just talking addictions to prescription meds, illicit drugs or alcohol … which are obviously things to address … but more generally we are talking about addictions to bad behaviours ... perhaps behaviours, so ingrained, that we never give them a second thought ... UNLESS we use Examen Discipline.

If we think about this just a little, we can see why the need for Examen discipline is not just for Jesuits OR hardcore derelicts or addicts OR people working in addiction recovery programs. **The need for Examen discipline is much more general, common or ordinary -- it might be for ALL people who are seeking to improve their lives.** 

We can start off thinking about addictions to things we might take or use, such as those perfectly legal, assumed safe, basically not feared [and probably not taken seriously enough] like the sugarized, professionally addiction-engineered, standard American diet of the supermarket or fast food outlets. But we should also think about how we use or abuse our digital devices and their addiction-engineered monetizable eyeball sticky distractions. And, of course we should think about lifestyles dependent upon the convenience and comfort of vehicles/major appliances with their engineered obsolescence or post-warranty bank account depleting failures. *Why do we have to work as hard as we do to afford the nice things we have grown dependent upon?*

We should understand that much of the economy in our affluent nations is based upon repeat customers and that companies have big incenctives to engineer or design-in the compelling addictions. It's not exactly purely malicious on the companies' part -- it's just part of what is necessary to stay in business.  As a result, the list of addiction-engineered products and services goes on and on and it is not just your imagination that really coolest, most *must-have* things are designed to make you a repeat long-term buying of the next *greatest thing since sliced bread*.  That's why you will buy these thing and almost before you know you might feel inadequate and unfulfilled because you need the new and improved version. ***Addicting consumers is how the stuff of the material-worshipping world works.***

If you are genuinely seeking to ditch your addictions, pursue self-improvement and discern your spiritual calling the Examen process  is something you should look into. It’s certain no an easy button thing, you probably will not feel better right away after starting … in fact, as you get into it, you will probably be scared, intimidated and completely overwhelmed by the challenges of UNexamined behavior patterns that you’ve been ignoring or getting by with … but by diligently going after the things that undermine your success, you will put yourself on the path to a much healthier and more fulfilling life. 

Your happiness will be directly correlated with the amount of diligent, serious effort you put into the Examen process … if you just go through the motions to make someone else happy, you will be more miserable and probably deservedly so, for even trying to convince someone you’re trying to improve, all the while knowing that you have no intention of really changing anything, especially if that change is about removing something, eg refrigerator time looking for a favorite snack, that furnishes you with emotional solace when you are feeling beleaguered.

Now … of course, it’s not easy … but relax, try to take it easy as you can and THINK as you do this … meditate or take long walks as you THINK; but as you do, never stop praying! As you are going through this process, you will quickly understand that it’s entirely about YOU and how YOU think about YOU. That kind of thing is something that is more or less supposed to terrify you … or else, you are not really trying …

The introspection is something that you have been doing ALL of your life, well at least until you started drinking your problems away OR turning on the football games to ignore your issues at work or the projects that you would rather not work on. You know your dodges, your escapes, the bad habits of being yourself, so you should factor in your reactions and issues … there’s no need to waste time reinventing some wheel that’s not broken or close enough to being round … fix what’s broken first, then fix or remove the stuff that’s good enough to put up with, but you just haven’t addressed yet … you only have so much time left, so you should prioritize your efforts to knock off the big things first so that you have more time and energy to go after the other things you’re tapering down. 

In other words, you should read through all of the following pages … let the material percolate and then read through it again … in all likelihood, after doing that you will want to adapt, revise, re-order and completely re-prioritize this list of 52 weekly topic foci. 

Sure, obviously, you can also add new categories that are not on this list of 52 topic areas and take off those that you are not worried about, based on your personal struggles … you should not be restricted to obeying this list; you really have to make it your own so that can spend more of your time on those things that are more urgent and important. 

This list is flexible, but it should include all kinds of things that you believe are consistent with the gist of this practice or approximately similar to the 52 weekly topic areas … but YOUR Examen list is YOUR list. This outline is only intended to be the START of your own personalization of YOUR Examen process … making it your own is entirely up to you and if you like, you can start with this list, see how it goes and edit/revise it after you get a few weeks in.

This extended list provides an EXAMPLE of a comprehensive framework for your year of intense focus. It’s not YOUR example, so you have to make it yours by adapting it to your unique needs and priorities. As you progress through your list of Examen topics each year, you will need to be open to new insights and discoveries about yourself and your true calling … so that when you work on your Examen process in the following year, you can be more diligent and precisely focused on your needs and God’s particular unique expectations for your life.

This deep inner work is a powerful journey of transformation. Be patient with yourself, ie you will fail and there will be times when you fill inadequate or not really up to the demands of leading your life, but don’t give in to the temptation to second-guess your Creator … celebrate your struggles, failures, doubts and you might even boldly, but privately take some of the credit for your progress … trust that you will LEAD a life of greater purpose, fulfillment, and authenticity.
