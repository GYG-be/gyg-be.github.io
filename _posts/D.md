## D. Pushing For 10X Productivity

This is in all realms ... soul, mind, body ... and not just about me, but it's also about directly [through my open source technology] and more importantly indirectly [through my example of independence, self-reliance and renunciation of the material realm] helping the people around me to be more productive, creative and valuable [or well-compensated and able to afford everything to help themselves, their families]. Managing time and resources effectively to maximize their impact for the Kingdom of God. This involves setting clear goals that align with biblical values, prioritizing tasks based on their eternal significance, and avoiding distractions that hinder spiritual growth and productivity. It also means recognizing the importance of rest and recreation, ensuring that personal energy levels are maintained to sustain long-term Kingdom service.
