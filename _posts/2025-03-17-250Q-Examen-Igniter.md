This is about reflection throughout the day and during Holy Hour the following day. The way I use this list, whenever I pull it up, is [get ten random numbers](https://numbergenerator.org/10randomnumbersbetween1and250) and then look at those ten items. As such, it is kind of an ***examen igniter*** basis for sparking examen journaling.
