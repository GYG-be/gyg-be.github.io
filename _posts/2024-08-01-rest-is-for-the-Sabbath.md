***NEVER look back, we are not going that way.***

*If your Creator rests only the Sabbath, then why aren't you creating every day of the week? Do you have to become so sedentary, so FRAIL, so focused on vegging out on the Laz-E-Boy at the THE END OF THE DAY?*

What about the train-eat-sleep-REPEAT cycle don't you understand? Where's the part in the cycle that tells you to feel sorry for yourself or to focus *like a victim* on being overwhelmed with worry about whatever is attacking you? *Have you not been commanded to ... see Joshua 1:9*

Part of what we do during our periods of ***PHYSICAL*** rest throughout the day is think intently, deeply about how we can be less frail and more productive when we are not resting.

# What is rest for, if not for recovery and preparation for building

Understand the principle behind REST ... train-eat-sleep-repeat means that sleep is not about the END; rather it is for being better able to complete the next cycle ... understand this principle, then build your own cycle ... you are welcome to clone this Frality Index [FI], but your Fraility Index has to be your own train-eat-sleep-repeat process of resting ***with a purpose***.

What I currently think of as being frail, or something that I wish to avoid, will not match your ideas of fraility ... and over time, my own ideas of what fraility means will change.

That's ok ... whatever I am developing WILL change, but I will still have the early sources to go back to.  Right now, my Fraility Index is in an EARLY STATE OF DEVELOPMENT ... this post is only about the gist of the theory behind this fraility index.

The medical profession has all kinds of suggested screenings and various sorts of bloodwork that are recommended ... it's fine and dandy to get all geeked out over the lab gear and the biochemistry that only nerds know ... but you should really that most of the medical diagnostic industry is based on the fact that these things generate revenue and keep labs and hospital beds at capacity -- even the personal medical diagnostic industry full of great companies like Keto-Mojo is still necessarily based on continuing to generate revenue by selling you test strips and lancets and consumable supplies.  This is all just *fine* ... but you **HAVE TO** ***UNDERSTAND*** *the business model of people* ***selling*** *you products and ongoing services.* **KNOW that you are being SOLD.**

To its credit, the medical profession is still very much populated by people who got into the profession because they were called to the mission of about making patients healthy and, as such, some of those professionals continue to develop things like FRAILITY INDEX metrics, for example [see link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499935/) ... you can look at medical literature on various different fraility indices, but a consistent self-serving pattern still emerges ... the medical FI almost always based upon bloodwork or some sort of professional assessment, eg, probing by a professional in  a clinic's anal love nest, which is calculated to result in more trips to the doctor or more swallowing of the pharmaceuticals.

My fraility index is much more INTENTLY practical ... it's kind of simple, but it's difficult in practice to stay on top of CONSISTENTLY ... because it is not an automated gadget [although it can incorporate data from gadgets] because it's based on human body measurement equipment, ie a trained, motivated brain connected to an actual aging body in various states of eustress, stress and pain ... the system uses the stuff which we are all born with, but it requires that we USE the equipment and pay attention to our intentions and exertion as we use it.



1) Bible study, prayer, meditation ... is a guy spiritually healthy being in a state of constant prayer with daily devotions, bible study and shared, but direct application of faith OR is a guy frail and dependent upon seeing a professional religious specialist?

2) Ordinarily, but irregularly varying levels of stress and activity.  When it snows, can a guy shovel his own sidewalks and driveways OR has he let his shoulders atrophy so that he needs a snowblower OR service that provides snow removal services?  Does a guy lift weights or engage in other kinds of exercise in order to be ready for snowstorms, floods, clean-up after tornadoes OR is a guy frail and dependent upon others?

3) Ordinary, daily/weekly levels of activity. Can a guy mow his lawn with a reel mower OR does he need a rider to haul his fat ass around or does he hire a lawnmowing service to come in and remove the grass and clippings. Can a guy work on his landscaping with spades, shovels, trip loopers, pruning shears, tree saws, axes, kukri, mattocks and wheelbarrow OR does he use a contractor with a skidsteers, trailers, various equipment like tree spades, stump chewers or trenchers to dig in the irrigation system?

4) Gratitude for creation ... can a guy enjoying the community he lives in but walking 5-10 miles a day pushing into Zone II level of exertion [where talking is possible in theory, but not comfortable in practice, thus brief, concise and only to-the-point] without being reminded that he should try to get a little exercise OR ... to put it a different way, how many days per month does a guy use his vehicle or his XUV to haul his fat ass to do errands which are mostly tied in some way to his visits to the anal love nest or some other "wellness" appointment?

5) Home maintenance and repairs, routine construction projects

6) Housework, cleaning, orderliness, 5S activities

7) Does a guy do at least 30 minutes of cardio six days a week, eg 8 4-minute HIIT Tabatas of intense exercise to push a guy to Zone V [highest level of exertion].

8) Does a guy roll on the mats every day doing solo drills and expanding his repertoire of new solo drills.

9) Does a guy use his heavy bag to routinely do high impact exercises to ensure that bone mass does not fade away, that tendon and joints stay pliable and callouses on knuckles do not disappear OR does a guy rely on the sheriff's deputies to show up when he dials 911?

10) Does a guy start new things, new ventures, new philanthropic projects, new activities which require Christian leadership and examples of Christian service to larger audiences?
