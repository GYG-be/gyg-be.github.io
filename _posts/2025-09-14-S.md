## S. Redeemed Identity

*What's your personal BRAND?* *Why would someone want to know you or seek you out*

Embracing one's identity in Christ, recognizing that true worth and value are found in Him alone. This involves rejecting worldly standards of success and beauty, renewing the mind with God's truth, and allowing the Holy Spirit to transform character and behavior. This secure identity in Christ fosters humility, gratitude, and a desire to live a life that pleases God.
