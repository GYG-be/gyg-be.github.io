## X. Faithful Perseverance and Compassion

*Everyone has a nice little plan for dealing with difficulty, until they get punched hard in the mouth.* 

We need to acknowledge the way that real pain, of the kind experienced by Job, is necessarily going to test our faith. How do we PRACTICE genuine compassion so that our *compassion muscle* is ready for the real fight. Genuine compassion requires not just acknowledging real pain but *crawling down into it* and understanding its root cause. There will be significantly important signals underlying the pain that help us understand. By contrast, idiot compassion involves getting out the checkbook to write checks in an attempt to buy freedom from guilt and forget about offering any genuine compassion. Navigating life transitions with trust in God's sovereignty, finding hope in grief, and embracing new seasons with compassion, faith and courage.
