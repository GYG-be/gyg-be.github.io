## N. Shepherd Leadership

Leading with humility, compassion, and a genuine desire to serve others, emulating the example of Jesus, the Good Shepherd. This involves guiding and protecting those under one's care, providing spiritual nourishment and direction, and correcting with love and gentleness. It also means recognizing and developing the potential in others, empowering them to use their gifts for God's Kingdom. This servant-hearted approach to leadership fosters an environment of trust, growth, and spiritual maturity.
