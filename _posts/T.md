## T. Kingdom Service

Using God-given gifts, talents, and resources to serve others and advance God's Kingdom. This involves actively participating in church ministries, volunteering in the community, and supporting missionary work. It also means using personal skills and expertise to mentor others, share the Gospel, and make a positive impact on the world. This commitment to service reflects a heart of gratitude for God's blessings and a desire to use them for His glory.
