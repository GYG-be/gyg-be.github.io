# KEEP Visual Score In A Room Where YOU Spend Time Every Day


In order to do this, get yourself a JUMBO OVERSIZED (36" x 100") ERASABLE laminated blank 12-month annual yearly planner wall poster with several boxes of colored dry-erase markers and four roll of 2-sided adhesive tape to mount your visual annual habit tracking system on a wall that has unobstructed 4' x 10' space ... the wall in your home gym / weightroom would be perfect, but it has to be in a place that you spend time in every day.

 The "Seinfeld strategy" is a productivity and habit-building technique inspired by comedian Jerry Seinfeld. While it's not directly related to Seinfeld's comedy, it's named after him due to an anecdote about his writing process. Here's a brief explanation of the strategy and how it relates to other approaches:

## Implementing The Seinfeld Strategy

Unless you have a much better idea, you are going to want to implement the ***CONSISTENCY trumps perfection*** "Seinfeld strategy" used by the young unknown comedian, when he was just another wannabe, before he became THE COMEDIAN Jerry Seinfeld. Of course, you are welcome to come up with better system, but it's worthy of imitating a system that works to relentlessly push and instantly give a visual tracking of progress.  Seinfeld's goals were about maximizing his writing production and quality EVERY SINGLE DAY ... but mostly, he recognized that quality comes from relentlessly consistent daily production and developing better and better metrics to track quality.

This system is not just for writing ... it's especially applicable to things like weightlifting, serious physical training or something like a fasting lifestyle to counter a life-threatening condition like cancer or diabetes / insulin resistance. ***CONSISTENCY trumps perfection*** although, it is through consistency that you are able to ***perfect*** your form and improve the quality of your practice.

### Essence of the VISUAL Seinfeld Strategy

1. Choose a task or habit you seriously NEED to develop consistency in ... this task or habit [or set of tasks/habits] has to map directly into your Big WHY. If you do not NEED to improve consistency this area, you won't really bother to do it.

2. INVEST space in your home for just tracking consistency in this one task or habit [or set of tasks/habits]; get a jumbo oversized wall calendar that shows a whole year along with markers and tape to mount that laminated calendar on your wall.  INVEST time each day in looking at your scoreboard and journalling about your performance ... remember -- if you don't NEED to do this, you just won't. *If you really do NEED to do this; this investment of space and time will be the best investment you ever made.* ***KNOW YOUR WHY!!!***

3. For each day you complete the task, mark an X on the calendar or, better yet color the whole or part of the day, according your own color-coding regime.

4. At first, you can focus on not just breaking the chain of X's or other simple little psychological games like that that you play with yourself, but overtime your consistency and quality of production will vary, eg, there will times where your production is ok, but somehow has plateaued or somehow not up to your standards or desired goals ... the POINT is look at the much bigger, more detailed picture and TRACK your consistency vs your quality of production.

5. Spend time looking at your visual score and thinking about improving your score for your satisfaction. You will probably want to get up each morning at 4:00 AM to just look at the graph and journal about progress as you do warmup exercises or other things.  This is all about ***KNOWING YOUR WHY!!!*** and dwelling on that WHY in order to help you get going at 4:00 AM. *Remember -- if you don't NEED to work on this task or habit, you just won't do it.* ***KNOW YOUR WHY!!!***


As with commitgraphs used in software development, the key principle is not really just something like "Don't break the chain" ... although at first, a nice string of visually connected marks of completions is enough to get started ... your implementation of this strategy actually NEEDS TO evolve and become much deeper, more connected to your WHY than that ... if you ***USE IT,***  the depth of your quality tracking regime will grow/improve/advance -- but you will need to USE your system in order to improve it ... perhaps, you should expect that you will "throw away" the first month or so as you get into tracking and realize that you are not capturing something important and need to change your system.

This VISUAL PHYSICAL system really emphasizes YOU ... just YOU, not some gadget or social media audience ... it's all about YOU treating YOU as someone who is worthy of caring about and that is what drives the importance of YOUR HABITS and your consistency in those habits ... it's not really intended for public consumption ... rather it's a PRIVATE thing for just YOU as you are perfecting your consistency and the quality of your practice ... it's about encouraging, tracking and autodidactic coaching of your own daily practice ... rather than sporadic bursts of intense effort or something you track with a fitness monitor -- those things are important, but your VISUAL PHYSICAL scoreboard is about YOU.

### Relationship to Other Habit Tracking Strategies

1. Stoicism:
   The Seinfeld Strategy aligns well with old, well-proven Stoic principles, particularly:
   - Focus on what you can control (eg, your daily actions; the form of correct execution of an exercise rather than the increasing weight on the bar)
   - Emphasize process over long journey, rather than outcome or glorious destination
   - Venerate practiced self-discipline and delayed gratification; embrace the suck

   Stoics like Marcus Aurelius emphasized daily practice and reflection, which resonates with the Seinfeld Strategy's focus on consistency and quality improvement.

2. Kaizen (Continuous Improvement):
   This Japanese philosophy emphasizes small, incremental improvements over time. Like the Seinfeld Strategy, it values consistency and developing a reputation for gradual, routine progress in serial fashion with and better and still better content over time, rather than relying dramatic blockbuster sequels.

3. Habit stacking (James Clear):
   This technique involves linking a new habit to an existing one. While not directly related to the Seinfeld Strategy, both approaches focus on building sustainable habits and "training in order to train at a higher level".

4. Minimum Viable Progress (MVP) or Minimal Viable Product:
   This concept, adapted from the business world, encourages launching SOMETHING prototypical that is at least worthy of trial ... to get feedback, to learn the unknown unknowns of how a product behaves outside the captivity of a safe development environment ... it's all about iterations and developing a reputation for making consistent, sometimes small but always consequential steps toward a continuously higher and higher goal rather than waiting for perfect conditions. Another word for this is TEST IN PRODUCTION.

5. "The War of Art" (Steven Pressfield):
   Pressfield's concept of "showing up every day" to overcome resistance aligns closely with the Seinfeld Strategy's emphasis on daily practice.

The Seinfeld Strategy's strength lies in its simplicity and focus on visible progress. 

Emphasizing consistency over perfection helps build momentum and reduce the psychological barriers to getting started at 4:00 AM looking a your progress in getting your most important tasks done. This approach can be particularly effective for developing skills, writing, exercise routines, or any area where regular practice is key to improvement.
