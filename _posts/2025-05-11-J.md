## J. Covenant Relationships

"Covenant" is another one of those loaded words, but we owe it to ourselves to think about exactly what this word means, why it was chosen and exactly how this agreement drives our service. Cultivating Christ-centered relationships marked by mutual respect, trust, and a shared lasting, ideally permanent commitment to biblical values. This involves prioritizing quality time with loved ones, practicing active listening and empathy, and offering forgiveness and grace in times of conflict. It also means surrounding oneself with godly influences and seeking accountability from fellow believers. This intentional approach to relationships fosters an environment of love, support, and spiritual growth.
