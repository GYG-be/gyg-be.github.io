[Place **Your Heart** in God - Bishop Barron Sunday Sermon](https://youtu.be/TvRjwrmMUYo?si=bM9dEya37-hsXWA5]

Bishop Barron's message is about drawing out that basic feature of biblical spirituality—namely, the ordering of the heart, that deepest organizing principle of one’s entire life, to the Lord ... ponder *what* ***kind of a person*** do I want to become?*
