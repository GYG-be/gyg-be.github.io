## T. Service To The Greater Good

*What exactly IS the GREATER good?*  The ultimate greatest greatness is that of the Creator ... and the Creator is still creating, partially through the efforts of billions of humans ... of course, the greatest greatness is far, far, far in excess of everything that humans can know or devise or even begin to contemplate, but the Creator is our example. Using God-given gifts, talents, and resources to serve others and advance God's Kingdom. This involves actively participating in church ministries, volunteering in the community, and supporting missionary work. It also means using personal skills and expertise to mentor others, share the Gospel, and make a positive impact on the world. This commitment to service reflects a heart of gratitude for God's blessings and a desire to use them for His glory.
