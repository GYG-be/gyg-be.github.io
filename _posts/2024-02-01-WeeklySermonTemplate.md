*Do not focus on the rear-view mirror, we are not going that way. Life is to be led, driving ahead, LOOKING FORWARD!"*

Facing forward and focusing **YOUR HEART** upon God is basic feature of biblical spirituality.

The ordering of the heart is deepest organizing principle of oneâ€™s entire life ... skipping the other *orientations* that self-centered humans have ... and instead, focusing TOWARD the Instantiator or Creator ... and TOWARD what the Creator intended you TO BECOME, from this point on.

Stop living in regret or, even worse, worrying about the future ... instead, FACE the future and ponder the essential question.

## What matters is about BECOMING

*What* ***kind of a person*** *do I want* **TO BECOME?**
