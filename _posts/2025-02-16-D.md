## D. Pushing For 10X-er Productivity

"10X-er" productivity is really about making OTHERS around oneself more productive, ie it's sort of like being a team player that coache the team to ALL ***become*** better, more productive team players with much higher expectations. Back in the dark ages [when Microsoft was developing Windows or Google was developing search engines], the 10X-er idea USED TO BE that some individual whiz could be 10 times more productive than others in a given area of life [*so companies wanted to hire that guy*] ... but that view of being a 10X-er is old, backward, inbred, antiquated thinking ... NOW, being a 10X-er is about being productive in one's own right, but also pushing and helping the entire team to step it up -- so that the entire team helps the productive person being more productive, especially in terms of team productivity. Pushing for 10X-er productivity really has to happen in all realms of one's life ... soul, mind, body ... and, if it weren't already obvious, the 10X-er thing is not just about me, but it's mainly for others *starting with me,* ***working on me***.

Some of this 10X-er is more of a direct push, through my open source technology development efforts and attempts to become better at open source dev communities, but more importantly perhaps, it is indirect thing that happens through my example of independence, self-reliance and renunciation of the material realm. The example, if I am successful or fail publicly and spectacularly ... *and, it's more likely to be the latter case* ... will help people around me, on their own paths to BECOMING more productive, creative and valuable [or well-compensated and able to afford everything to help themselves, their families]. Managing time and resources effectively to maximize their impact for the Kingdom of God. This involves setting clear goals that align with biblical values, prioritizing tasks based on their eternal significance, and avoiding distractions that hinder spiritual growth and productivity. It also means recognizing the importance of rest and recreation, ensuring that personal energy levels are maintained to sustain long-term Kingdom service.
