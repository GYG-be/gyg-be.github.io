## D. Pushing For 10X-er Productivity

"10X-er" productivity is really about making OTHERS around oneself more productive, ie it's sort of like being a team player that coache the team to ALL ***become*** better, more productive team players with much higher expectations. Back in the dark ages [when Microsoft was developing Windows or Google was developing search engines], the 10X-er idea USED TO BE that some individual whiz could be 10 times more productive than others in a given area of life [*so companies wanted to hire that guy*] ... but that view of being a 10X-er is old, backward, inbred, antiquated thinking ... NOW, being a 10X-er is about being productive in one's own right, but also pushing and helping the entire team to step it up -- so that the entire team helps the productive person being more productive, especially in terms of team productivity. Team productivity in this 10X-er sinse is not some *nice*, trite, ["sing Kumbaya"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sing_Kumbaya) material -- this is about raising expectations for the team and expecting elite performance from everyone or sub-par players head to the sidelines and get into a different game they're better suited for. Pushing for 10X-er productivity really has to happen in all realms of one's life ... soul, mind, body ... and, if it weren't already obvious, the 10X-er thing is not just about me, but it's mainly for others *starting with me,* ***working on me***.

Some of this 10X-er is more of a direct push, through my open source technology development efforts and attempts to become better at open source dev communities, but more importantly perhaps, it is indirect thing that happens through my example of independence, self-reliance and renunciation of the material realm. The example, if I am successful or fail publicly and spectacularly ... *and, it's more likely to be the latter case* ... will help people around me, on their own paths to BECOMING more productive, creative and valuable [or well-compensated and able to afford everything to help themselves, their families]. Managing time and resources effectively to maximize their impact for the Kingdom of God. This involves setting clear goals that align with biblical values, prioritizing tasks based on their eternal significance, and avoiding distractions that hinder spiritual growth and productivity. It also means recognizing the importance of rest and recreation, ensuring that personal energy levels are maintained to sustain long-term Kingdom service.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Foundations and Mindset

1. **What does "10X productivity" mean to me in the context of Kingdom work rather than worldly success?**

   - [Matthew 6:33](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html) - "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." This verse establishes the priority of Kingdom work over worldly concerns, suggesting that true productivity begins with right priorities.
   
   - [Colossians 3:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-23.html) - "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." This passage reframes our understanding of productivity as service to God rather than achievement for self or others.

2. **How might my definition of productivity differ from my Creator's definition? How can I better discern this difference and make corrections more rapidly?**

   - [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/55/Isaiah-55-8.html) - "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." This fundamental passage acknowledges the gap between human and divine perspectives, suggesting that our definitions of productivity may be fundamentally limited compared to God's eternal view.
   
   - [Proverbs 16:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-9.html) - "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps." This verse reminds us that while we may define productivity in terms of our own planning and achievements, God's providence ultimately determines the true value and direction of our work.

3. **Other than Christ's examples of the loaves and fishes, what do other biblical examples demonstrate extraordinary Kingdom productivity?**

   - [Joshua 1:7-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/1/Joshua-1-7.html) - "Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go... Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go." This passage shows that Joshua's extraordinary leadership productivity came from obedience to God's word and courageous action based on divine promises.
   
   - [Acts 9:1-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/9/Acts-9-1.html) - This passage recounts Saul's dramatic conversion to become Paul, demonstrating how God can completely transform a person's direction and multiply their Kingdom impact. Paul's productivity shifted from persecuting the church to becoming its greatest missionary and author.
   
   - [Acts 2:1-47](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/2/Acts-2-1.html) - The outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost transformed ordinary disciples into extraordinarily effective witnesses, resulting in 3,000 conversions in a single day. This demonstrates that supernatural productivity comes through divine empowerment rather than human effort alone.

4. **What personal mindsets or beliefs currently limit my productivity potential?**

   - [Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html) - "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will." This verse indicates that worldly thought patterns must be identified and transformed to align with God's perspective, which unlocks greater Kingdom productivity.
   
   - [2 Corinthians 10:5](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/10/2-Corinthians-10-5.html) - "We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ." This passage teaches the necessity of identifying and addressing limiting beliefs and thought patterns that oppose God's truth in our lives.

5. **How must I distinguish between godly ambition and worldly striving?**

   - [Philippians 2:3-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-3.html) - "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." This passage contrasts selfish ambition with humble service, providing a key distinction between worldly and godly productivity.
   
   - [James 3:13-17](https://www.bibleref.com/James/3/James-3-13.html) - "Who is wise and understanding among you?

But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." This passage contrasts earthly and heavenly wisdom, offering criteria to distinguish between godly and worldly ambition.

6. **What fears might be preventing me from pursuing dramatic productivity increases?**

   - [2 Timothy 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-7.html) - "For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline."

   - [Joshua 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/1/Joshua-1-9.html) - "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.

   - [Ephesians 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html) - "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus..." This passage encourages spiritual athletes to constantly improve performance while maintaining focus on Christ rather than circumstances.

10. **What would true abundance look like in my soul, mind, and body?**

    - [John 10:10](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-10.html) - "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."

This passage warns against materialism's spiritual dangers, suggesting that technology use must be guided by contentment rather than acquisition drive.
    
    - [Matthew 6:19-21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) - "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven... For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Jesus redirects focus from temporary to eternal investments, suggesting that technology should serve Kingdom values rather than worldly accumulation.

### Rest and Sustainability

71. **How does biblical rest differ from mere cessation of activity?**

    - [Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-8.html) - "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy... For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

74. **What early warning signs indicate I'm approaching burnout or diminishing returns?**

    - [1 Kings 19:4-8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/19/1-Kings-19-4.html) - "He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die... All at once an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.'... He ate and drank and then lay down again. The angel of the LORD came back a second time... Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God." Elijah's experience illustrates that physical exhaustion, emotional despair, and withdrawal can signal burnout, while God's response emphasizes physical restoration as prerequisite to spiritual renewal.

    - [Isaiah 58:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/58/Isaiah-58-13.html) - "If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, then you will find your joy in the LORD..." This passage connects Sabbath renewal with delight, honor, and joy in the Lord rather than self-focused pleasure, suggesting that genuine renewal comes through God-centered rather than self-centered rest.
    
    - [Mark 2:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/2/Mark-2-27.html) - "Then he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.'"

    - [Ecclesiastes 5:18-20](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/5/Ecclesiastes-5-18.html) - "This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them... This is the gift of God. Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God." This passage affirms enjoyment of life's simple pleasures as divine gift, suggesting that recreation activities that foster gratitude and appreciation may be most restorative.

77. **How might I better transition between intense work and genuine rest?**

    - [Mark 6:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-31.html) - "Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, 'Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.'"

    - [Hebrews 4:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-9.html) - "There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience." This passage reframes rest as something to actively pursue rather than passively receive, suggesting that rest requires intentional effort and that its neglect constitutes disobedience.

79. **How can I build margin into my life that actually enhances rather than reduces productivity?**

    - [Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/11/Matthew-11-28.html) - "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." Jesus paradoxically offers rest through taking on His yoke, suggesting that proper constraints and structure actually create freedom and productivity.
    
    - [Exodus 23:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/23/Exodus-23-12.html) - "Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed." This command connects regular margin with both asset longevity (animals) and human refreshment, suggesting that productivity sustainability requires consistent rather than occasional margin.

80. **What would it mean to be ten times more efficient at recognizing and responding to my need for rest?**

    - [Psalm 46:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/46/Psalm-46-10.html) - "He says, 'Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.'"

    - [Galatians 5:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-1.html) - "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'" Jesus' Great Commission envisions global discipleship multiplication, suggesting that Kingdom productivity movements create both breadth and depth of transformation.

It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work... If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames."

    - [Matthew 25:14-30](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-14.html) - This parable of the talents demonstrates that God entrusts resources according to ability and expects productive deployment, suggesting that Kingdom impact correlates with faithful multiplication rather than mere preservation of resources.
    
    - [Luke 16:10-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-10.html) - "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?

Jesus connects resource faithfulness with spiritual entrustment, suggesting that material stewardship directly impacts spiritual responsibility.

98. **What season of life am I in, and how should that inform my productivity expectations?**

    - [Ecclesiastes 3:1-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/3/Ecclesiastes-3-1.html) - "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens..."

100. **What is God's unique 10X vision for my life that only I can fulfill?**

     - [Jeremiah 29:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/29/Jeremiah-29-11.html) - "'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the LORD, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.'"

     - [Ephesians 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html) - "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."
