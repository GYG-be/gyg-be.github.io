## B. Holiness As A Lifestyle Choice

It's not a place, or a building or a group of individuals. Holiness is a PERSONAL choice. It starts with holy hour beginning every day and keeping the Sabbath holy in order to BEGIN every week. Holiness is not about resting, although we do try to devote the Sabbath to rest -- it's mostly about resurrection and spiritual renewal, looking forward not regretting the past or thinking that we've earned a few hours of laziness. Holiness as a lifestyle is aobut acknowledging each day's holy hour and each week's Sabbath as a sacred time ordained by God FOR RENEWAL. Renewal can include attending church services but is mostly about engaging in the personal worship of lifestyle, with time for solitude, reflection, and also fellowship. Holiness as a lifestyle involves incorporating regular spiritual disciplines throughout the week, as the default activity, ie rather than watching TV or scrolling through social media ... this means things like physical prayer, Bible study, and meditation, and everythint that is about maintain a consistent constant connection with God to manage or, if necessary, even ignore the ephemeral stresses of daily life.
