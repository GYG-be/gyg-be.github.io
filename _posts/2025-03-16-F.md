## F. Soul-Mind-Body Harmony

Nurturing holistic well-being by integrating spiritual, emotional, and physical health practices. Practice means actually doing the reps, the DISCIPLINE of doing what one would rather not do ... because the discipline of exercise that ultimately provides the basis of mental and emotional freedom, which support spiritual freedom. Soul-Mind-Body harmony involves prioritizing spiritual GROWTH through ingest spiritual nutrients -- this mean regular engagement with God's Word and prayer, seeking emotional healing and support through biblical counseling or trusted Christian community, and maintaining physical health through exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. This integrated approach recognizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of human life and seeks to honor God with every part of one's being.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Understanding Integration and Wholeness

1. **How does Scripture's view of humans as integrated whole spiritual beings, but differ from the materialist modern perspectives?**
   
   - [1 Thessalonians 5:23](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-23.html) - "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your WHOLE ***1)*** spirit, **2)** soul and *3)* body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." *Notice the order; the order tells us that the material perspective comes last OR, more accurately, is in service of or subject to the preceding priorities, ie body serves soul, soul and body serve spiritual essence.

   - [Mark 12:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-30.html) - "Love **the Lord your God** with ***all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength***." We are to love our Creator, giving that love FIRST priority; we are to love all others as we love ourselves, but that is a SECOND priority. "Heart" is from the Greek root word kardia, and means the center of one's life, whether physical, spiritual, or mental. The heart drives one's beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and intentions. "Soul" is from the Greek root word psychē which is similar to the heart, but focuses on the vital force that keeps us alive. "Mind" is not found in the original Old Testament quote (Deuteronomy 6:5, see below), but is certainly appropriate to add for an audience influenced by more logical Greek culture. It comes from the Greek root word dianoia and, again, has a similar definition to heart but with a more mental bent.
   
   - [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-5.html) - "Love **the LORD your God** with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." Verse like this show me why the Bible is so important to study, because of how it is about evolvution of culture and mindsets over 1000s of years. The fact that mind is not included here illustrates something about how the ancient saw life as primarily a matter of defined by heart and soul and strength; in other words, the human experience was not yet intellectual or dedicated to the mind or anything remotely similar to having a socratic or platonic or aristotelian or philosophic influence of any kind. The ancients were extremely simple, much less capable in many ways, but were much less neurotic, self-obsessed and meta-cognitive than we moderns are. At the time Deuteronomy was written, the concept of "mind" would have been almost unknown or perhaps, if it was known, seen as being "New Agey" or as futuristic speculative proto-Greek bs and and not to be trusted. The life of the mind has been a tremendous blessing to humanity. Our consumption of knowledge has defined how we think about developing ourselves, how we order and plan our lives and it has certainly given us the ability to think about abstract principles and thus solve problems that humans could not begin to even contemplate in an ancient world -- just as texts, priests, scriptures changed the minds and then lives and capabilities and ability to reason of the ancients, programattic knowledge we see in AI and knowledge engineering will similarly transform humans as we go forward, AS THE CREATOR CLEARLY INTENDED.

2. **What biblical examples demonstrate the ancient's better interconnection between spiritual, mental, and physical well-being?**

   - [Proverbs 4:20-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-22.html) - "My son, pay attention to what I say; *turn your ear to my words* [ie, Solomon tells his son, to "do as I say, not as I do"]. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body." Discerning the WILL of the Creator, including for one's own time mgmt priorities, exercise, diet, sleep, sobriety, overall well-being, coming up with a plan and then consistently sticking with ***"the plan"*** is the way to avoid unnecessary, foreseeable disaster.

   - [3 John 1:2](https://www.bibleref.com/3-John/1/3-John-1-2.html) - "***Beloved***, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul." The apostle John was quite old by the time he wrote this letter to his dear Christian friend Gaius who was of a similar age. "*As it goes well with your soul*" is a gentle reminder to Gaius, a contemporary of John's, who knew [but maybe needed a gentle reminder] that physical health, or one's ability to deal with severely declining physical health, derives from, or is of secondary importance to, spiritual health. The interconnections is definitely NOT a matter of equivalence or trade-offs; there is a priority to what must come first.

   - [Psalm 103:1-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/103/Psalm-103-5.html) - "Praise the LORD, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name... who ***satisfies you with good*** so that your youth is renewed like the eagle 's." It's important to remember that "good" is something defined according to God's perfect wisdom (Isaiah 55:8), not ours. Everything God has created has a good purpose (1 Timothy 4:4), even if we cannot fully understand all things.

3. **How has my understanding of holistic stewardship continued to evolve throughout my faith journey?**
   - [1 Corinthians 6:19-20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-19.html) - This passage emphasizes that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, highlighting the sacred responsibility we have to care for our physical selves as part of our spiritual devotion. Our bodies are not merely vessels but sacred dwelling places of God's Spirit.
   
   - [Romans 12:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-1.html) - Paul urges believers to present their bodies as "living sacrifices," suggesting that physical stewardship is itself an act of worship. This transforms our understanding of bodily care from mere health maintenance to spiritual offering.
   
   - [1 Peter 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/4/1-Peter-4-10.html) - This verse frames stewardship in terms of using our gifts to serve others, broadening the concept beyond self-care to community impact. True holistic stewardship recognizes that our well-being is intended to overflow into service to others.

4. **Which aspects of soul-mind-body harmony do I currently neglect or overemphasize?**
   - [Ecclesiastes 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/4/Ecclesiastes-4-6.html) - This wisdom teaches that "better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil," revealing how overwork and excessive striving create imbalance.

   - [Proverbs 11:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/11/Proverbs-11-1.html) - This proverb about "dishonest scales" metaphorically applies to imbalanced living, showing God's desire for appropriate proportion in all dimensions of life. Just as God values honesty in commerce, He values balance in how we steward all aspects of our being.

5. **How can I better self-regulate or recognize when one dimension of my being is significantly out of balance?**
   - [Psalm 139:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-23.html) - David's prayer for God to search his heart demonstrates the importance of divine examination in self-awareness. Inviting God's scrutiny is a powerful practice for uncovering imbalances we might otherwise miss.
   
   - [Proverbs 16:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-32.html) - This proverb values self-control above physical power, suggesting that mastery of one's internal state is a crucial indicator of well-being. True strength lies not in dominating others but in governing oneself.
   
   - [Galatians 5:22-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) - Paul lists the fruit of the Spirit, which includes self-control, providing benchmarks for spiritual health that affect all dimensions of being. These qualities serve as a diagnostic tool for assessing spiritual wellness.

6. **What resistance do I feel toward viewing discipline in one area as affecting all others?**
   - [James 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-10.html) - James teaches that stumbling at one point of the law makes one guilty of breaking all of it, illustrating the interconnectedness of spiritual obligations. This principle supports the idea that all areas of discipline are linked.

This powerfully illustrates how weakness in one area creates vulnerability throughout one's life.

   - [John 1:14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-14.html) - "The Word became flesh" reveals God's affirmation of physical existence through Christ's incarnation. This central Christian doctrine validates the material world and physical embodiment as worthy of divine presence.

   - [Genesis 1:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-31.html) - God's declaration that all creation was "very good" establishes the inherent goodness of the material world, countering gnostic tendencies to devalue the physical.
