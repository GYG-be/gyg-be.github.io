## E. Constancy of Purpose

Consistency, *consistency*, **CONSISTENCY** ... constancy of purpose is about consistently working on consistency ... because discipline ultimately equals freedom ... EXCEPT that constancy is about LOVE, flexibility and never giving up -- whereas consistency and discipline can *seem* rigid and brittle. This is about aligning daily routines, tiny little habits, and priorities reflected in those habits and ordinary routines with God's Will, creating an environment that fosters, even demands spiritual growth and Kingdom impact. This involves intentionally incorporating spiritual disciplines into daily life, such as prayer, Bible study, and meditation, and making choices that reflect a commitment to God's will. It also means surrounding oneself with godly influences, seeking accountability from fellow believers, and actively pursuing opportunities to share the Gospel and make a difference in the world.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Understanding Constancy

1. **What does "constancy of purpose" mean to me personally in my spiritual journey? In my journey physically OR as a professional?**

   - [Hebrews 12:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-1.html) - "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith." This verse emphasizes maintaining focus on Christ as the ultimate goal, which is the essence of spiritual constancy.
   
   - [Philippians 3:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-13.html) - "Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." Paul demonstrates constancy by maintaining singular focus despite past failures or successes, showing how constancy requires both forward vision and persistence.

2. **How do I distinguish between godly discipline and mere human willpower? Why might they *feel* like the same thing?**

   - [Galatians 5:22-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law." This passage indicates that true godly discipline is a fruit of the Spirit rather than self-generated effort, suggesting the source and motivation differ from human willpower.
   
   - [1 Corinthians 9:24-27](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/9/1-Corinthians-9-24.html) - "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize... I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize." Paul uses athletic discipline as a metaphor for spiritual discipline, which may explain why godly discipline and human willpower can feel similarâ€”both involve intentional effort and self-denial, but differ in their ultimate purpose and power source.

3. **What biblical figures exemplify unwavering constancy, and what can I learn from them?**

   - [Daniel 6:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Daniel/6/Daniel-6-10.html) - "Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before." Daniel demonstrated constancy by maintaining his prayer routine even when it became illegal, showing how true constancy persists even under threat.
   
   - [2 Timothy 4:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-7.html) - "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day." Paul's testimony at the end of his life demonstrates lifelong constancy despite immense persecution and hardship.
   
   - [Job 1:20-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Job/1/Job-1-20.html) - "At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship and said: 'Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.' In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing." Job maintained constancy of faith even in devastating circumstances, showing how constancy doesn't mean absence of grief but faithful response within it.

4. **How has my understanding of spiritual discipline evolved over time?**

   - [2 Peter 3:18](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-18.html) - "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen." This verse emphasizes that spiritual growth is a process, suggesting our understanding of spiritual discipline should also develop over time rather than remain static.
   
   - [Philippians 1:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/1/Philippians-1-6.html) - "Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus." This reminds us that spiritual development is ultimately God's work, indicating that mature spiritual discipline acknowledges divine agency rather than relies solely on human effort.

5. **What aspects of God's character reflect His constancy, and why should I even aspire to reflect an example so immaculately perfect?**

   - [Malachi 3:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-6.html) - "I the LORD do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed." God's immutability is the ultimate example of constancy, and becomes the foundation for our trust in His covenant promises.
   
   - [Hebrews 13:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/13/Hebrews-13-8.html) - "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." Christ's unchanging nature provides a reliable touchstone for disciples seeking to develop constancy in a changing world.
   
   - [James 1:17](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-17.html) - "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows." This verse ties God's constancy to His goodness, suggesting that our aspiration toward constancy reflects our desire to embody divine goodness, even if imperfectly.

6. **How do I define freedom in Christ and only through Christ, and how does discipline lead to this freedom?**

   - [John 8:31-32](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-31.html) - "To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, 'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'" This passage connects disciplined adherence to Christ's teaching with genuine freedom, suggesting that spiritual freedom comes through structured commitment rather than absence of constraints.
   
   - [Galatians 5:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-1.html) - "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." Paul emphasizes that Christian freedom must be actively maintained through disciplined resistance to legalism and sin.
   
   - [Romans 6:17-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/6/Romans-6-17.html) - "But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness." This passage redefines freedom not as autonomy but as liberation from sin's dominion, achieved through disciplined obedience to righteous teaching.

7. **What are the differences between consistency driven by performance versus constancy driven by love?**

   - [1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/13/1-Corinthians-13-1.html) - "If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal... If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing." Paul clearly distinguishes between actions performed without love and those motivated by love, emphasizing that consistency without love is spiritually worthless.
   
   - [Matthew 23:25-28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-25.html) - "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence... You appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness." Jesus critiques religious performance that maintains external consistency while neglecting inner transformation, highlighting how performance-driven consistency can become spiritually counterproductive.

8. **How might legalism, rulekeeping and unthinking, mindless adherence to tradition masquerade as constancy of purpose in my life?**

   - [Colossians 2:20-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-20.html) - "Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules... Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence." Paul warns that rule-based religiosity can appear disciplined while actually distracting from genuine spiritual growth.
   
   - [Matthew 15:1-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/15/Matthew-15-1.html) - "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'" Jesus critiques how traditions can replace genuine devotion, showing how habitual religious practices can be performed without heart engagement.

9. **What role does divine grace play in maintaining spiritual consistency?**

   - [2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-9.html) - "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me." Paul reveals that divine grace operates most powerfully in our weakness, suggesting that grace enables consistency precisely when human strength fails.
   
   - [Ephesians 2:8-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html) - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithâ€”and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of Godâ€”not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." This passage establishes that grace precedes and enables good works rather than follows from them, indicating that spiritual consistency flows from grace rather than earns it.
   
   - [Romans 5:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/5/Romans-5-1.html) - "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand." Paul describes grace as a realm in which believers "stand," suggesting that grace provides the stable foundation for consistent Christian living.

10. **How do I balance faithfulness to commitments with flexibility and LOVE to the Spirit's leading?**

-  [Acts 16:6-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/16/Acts-16-6.html) - "Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia... During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, 'Come over to Macedonia and help us.' After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them." This narrative shows Paul balancing commitment to his mission with flexibility to the Spirit's redirecting guidance.
    
-  [Galatians 5:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-25.html) - "Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit." This verse portrays spiritual life as a dance that requires both structured movement and responsive adaptation to the Spirit's leading.
    
-  [Romans 8:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-14.html) - "For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God." This identifies Spirit-led adaptability as a marker of genuine divine relationship, suggesting that true faithfulness sometimes requires deviating from rigid plans.

-  [Ephesians 4:26-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-26.html) - "'In your anger do not sin': Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."

-  [1 Peter 5:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-8.html) - "Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me."

In the future, when your children ask you, "What do these stones mean?" tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD.'"

For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." Peter provides a progressive development sequence for spiritual qualities, suggesting that tracking growth involves assessing both presence and increasing measure of specific virtues.
    
-  [Philippians 1:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/1/Philippians-1-9.html) - "And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christâ€”to the glory and praise of God."

If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven... But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."

-  [Galatians 1:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/1/Galatians-1-10.html) - "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people?

79. **How do I ensure my spiritual growth translates into practical love and service?**

-  [James 2:14-17](https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-14.html) - "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." James insists that authentic faith produces practical action, suggesting that genuine spiritual growth naturally manifests in tangible service.
    
-  [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/25/Matthew-25-31.html) - "For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me...

I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength."

It is the Lord Christ you are serving." Paul reframes all work as service to Christ, suggesting that spiritual integration involves recognizing divine purpose in ordinary professional activities rather than compartmentalizing sacred and secular domains.
    
-  [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-31.html) - "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." This instruction expands spiritual purpose to encompass all activities, indicating that professional work becomes worship when performed with God-glorifying intention.

92. **What would greater alignment between my public and private spiritual consistency look like?**

-  [Matthew 23:25-28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-25.html) - "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence... You appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness." Jesus condemns the disconnect between public religious performance and private character, suggesting that authentic spiritual consistency involves inner transformation rather than mere external conformity.
    
-  [Psalm 51:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/51/Psalm-51-6.html) - "Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place." The psalmist acknowledges God's desire for internal truth, indicating that genuine spiritual alignment begins with honesty in the hidden aspects of life that only God sees.

93. **How can I better integrate physical stewardship with spiritual disciplines?**

-  [1 Corinthians 6:19-20](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/6/1-Corinthians-6-19.html) - "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies." Paul establishes physical bodies as sacred space indwelt by God's Spirit, suggesting that caring for physical health constitutes spiritual worship rather than merely practical maintenance.
    
-  [Romans 12:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-1.html) - "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to Godâ€”this is your true and proper worship."

-  [2 Corinthians 10:5](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/10/2-Corinthians-10-5.html) - "We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ." This verse describes active engagement with ideas that oppose divine truth, indicating that spiritual constancy requires thoughtful evaluation rather than blind acceptance or rejection of intellectual claims.

95. **How might I better align my financial decisions with my spiritual commitments?**

-  [Matthew 6:19-21](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-19.html) - "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Jesus connects financial priorities with heart orientation, suggesting that spending patterns both reflect and reinforce spiritual values.
    
-  [Malachi 3:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Malachi/3/Malachi-3-10.html) - "'Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,' says the LORD Almighty, 'and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.'" This divine invitation to financial testing frames giving as an opportunity for experiencing God's provision, indicating that generosity functions as both spiritual discipline and pathway to blessing.

96. **What relational patterns need greater consistency to reflect my spiritual values?**

-  [1 John 4:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-7.html) - "Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

-  [Ephesians 4:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-1.html) - "As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace." Paul identifies specific relational qualities that demonstrate spiritual calling, indicating that daily interactions provide the proving ground for abstract spiritual values.

97. **How do I maintain consistency in using my unique gifts and talents for Kingdom purposes?**

-  [1 Peter 4:10-11](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/4/1-Peter-4-10.html) - "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ." Peter frames gift-use as stewardship of divine grace, suggesting that consistent service employs personal abilities while acknowledging their divine source.
    
-  [Romans 12:6-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-6.html) - "We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully." Paul encourages appropriate expression of diverse spiritual gifts, indicating that consistent kingdom service involves faithfulness to one's particular calling rather than imitation of others' roles.

98. **What would complete integrity between my beliefs and actions look like?**

-  [James 1:22-25](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-22.html) - "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in itâ€”not forgetting what they have heard, but doing itâ€”they will be blessed in what they do." James contrasts mere hearing with active obedience, suggesting that integrity involves sustained application of known truth rather than temporary acknowledgment.
    
-  [Matthew 7:24-27](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-24.html) - "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash." Jesus uses the building metaphor to illustrate how obedience provides stability during life's challenges, indicating that integrity between belief and action creates resilience rather than merely theoretical correctness.

99. **How can I better integrate contemplative practices with active service?**

-  [Luke 10:38-42](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-38.html) - "As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made... 'Martha, Martha,' the Lord answered, 'you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are neededâ€”or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.'" This narrative contrasts Martha's anxious activity with Mary's attentive listening, suggesting that genuine service flows from contemplative connection rather than replacing it.
    
-  [James 2:14-26](https://www.bibleref.com/James/2/James-2-14.html) - "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?... As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead." James insists that authentic faith produces practical action, indicating that contemplation and service exist in symbiotic relationship rather than competition
    
100. **What next specific step would most strengthen the constancy of my spiritual purpose?**

- [Philippians 3:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-13.html) - "Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." Paul models focused forward momentum in spiritual development, suggesting that consistency strengthens through deliberate advancement rather than passive maintenance.
    
- [Hebrews 12:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-1.html) - "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith." This exhortation identifies both removing hindrances and focusing on Christ as essential for spiritual advancement, indicating that strengthening constancy involves both elimination of obstacles and positive orientation toward Jesus.
