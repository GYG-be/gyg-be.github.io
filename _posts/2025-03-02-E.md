## E. Constancy of Purpose

Consistency, consistency, consistency. Discipline ultimately equals freedom. This is about aligning daily routines, habits, and priorities with God's Will, creating an environment that fosters spiritual growth and Kingdom impact. This involves intentionally incorporating spiritual disciplines into daily life, such as prayer, Bible study, and meditation, and making choices that reflect a commitment to God's will. It also means surrounding oneself with godly influences, seeking accountability from fellow believers, and actively pursuing opportunities to share the Gospel and make a difference in the world.
