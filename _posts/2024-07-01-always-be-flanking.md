The knife does not want to go the grindstone to be sharpened, but there's nothing other than the sharpening process that can remove the dullness that stands in the way of the knife being useful and fit for its purpose.

Flanking is a strategy that has been proven in wars and battles ... we are to always being flanking ... and always thinking about different ways that we might be flanked, ie not just from the sides, but from above or below or from different dimensions or from playing with time/tempo.

Aggression and counter-aggression is about continual sharpening ... about trying to get a better edge.

# Cheat! Steal lifehacks that work! 

Right now ... there's a A LOT of [awesome work being done with AI agents](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents) ... some of the best stuff includes [open source AI agent projects](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents?tab=readme-ov-file#open-source-projects) ... but we should not rule out looking at the [closed-source projects and proprietary companies showcasing their tools](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents?tab=readme-ov-file#closed-source-projects-and-companies), *typically in a freemium or available at very affordable subscription prices.*

NEVER settle; never get complacent ... ***ALWAYS BE FLANKING*** your own mindset. Develop ways to force yourself to get better self-awareness.

Based on your experience with time mgmt and organizational toolchains, experiment with new systems of time mgmt and organization.

Brainstorm ways to make your hacks even better.  This is why we want to **continually brainstorm the discipline of brainstorming.**  To really brainstorm, we need to PUSH a bit on building the discipline of brainstorming itself. We cannot afford to just look at the top three or five as we normally do with *googlestorming* ideation. We really need to ***PUSH*** a bit harder and think ... or develop mastery of the new world of AI-assisted and retrieval-assisted generative AI for better ideation.

### ELIMINATE Non-Value-Added Time of Commuting or Traveling To Meetings

Level up your game for virtual meetings and conferences

## Develop YOUR OWN List of 100 Best Practices for Virtual Meetings and Conferences

This is another case of OWNING your own practice ... steal, copy, fork, clone, revise, improve ... make these practices your OWN and then work at making them better.

## For Participants

1. Design, tailor, implement, customize and improve your own personalized virtual meeting environment that maximizes your productivity and engagement … it is best to wait with buying any additional gear, you might imagine this requires, until AFTER understanding these best practices and getting more practice with virtual meetings and web conferences, ie “pick the lowest hanging, cheapest fruit first, but get some perspective and size up the whole orchard of trees.” 

2. Develop a pre-meeting ritual [even if it’s very brief] to mentally prepare and transition into the virtual space; if you have a day full of different virtual meetings, webinars and similar material, you probably want to have a daily routine that involves early morning preparation, exercise, time to review/respond to emails/txts so that you can be fully present when you need to be, ie the virtual realm is no different than the physical realm in this respect – to the extent you can, remove the distractions before they distract.

3. Create a system, a professional brand, an identifiable persona, a speaking/chat style for organizing and prioritizing your presentations, extemporaneous contributions, chats during meetings ... this is a lot tougher than it first sounds -- in order to make it look effortless, you must first put in a lot of effort trying different things, failing, revising your system, so that you can be an *overnight* success in a completely ***effortless*** fashion. 

4. Become proficient in the webconf or virtual meeting interface, so that you are never *the luddite problem* in a meeting, you certainly don’t want to be the guy chewing food while his mic is unmuted, but mostly proficiency in the interface is about habit stacking and being able to creatively invent betters ways to communicate, especially non-verbal cues, visual information and emojis effectively in a virtual setting … remember, LESS is MORE in a realm full of different distractions, but a SMILE or HEART comes across.

5. Develop and improve upon your a personal toolkit of digital resources and apps, ie using Canva with Zoom, with your own Canva webconf templates to enhance your participation and engage your audience … do this without getting too clever and or actually distracting your audience with your toolkit magic act, ie remember LESS is MORE.

6. Formulate strategies to maintain focus and avoid ALL distractions [digital and otherwise], especially during long sessions … if you are in control of the agenda, try to avoid letting meeting sessions become too long, ie stick to 5 minute AMA sessions, 10 minute help sessions, 30 minute mtg/conf session format… LESS is MORE … LESS is MORE … LESS is MORE … minimalist discipline comes down to more vigilance on the little things, eg always be pruning/closing browser windows.
