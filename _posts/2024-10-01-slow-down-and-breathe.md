# The BigWhy App HAS TO BE META AI Driven

It's not just that *everyone* is already asking AI questions ... and that *everyone* already understands the importance of prompt engineering, LangGraph, et al ... and has moved on to thinking about agentic workflows and smart contracts and tools for developing smarter, more agentic, more collaborative workflows.

Ok ... maybe almost *everyone* needs a **bit** of primer on how to USE AI effectively, optimally ... but the Big WHY App is about keeping all of the WHYS supporting the BIG WHY aligned ... so that one isn't off in the weeds, chasing something new and shiny.

The BIG WHY is about STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT ... and USING the tools, best practices, best ideas to work on that strategic alignment.

We can best illustrate how to USE AI by looking at how we use AI to develop the expertise to SLOW DOWN AND BREATHE.

## Slow down and just BREATHE

Let's work on breathwork ... and let's USE AI to help us autodidactically become much more knowledgeable about breathwork ... so that we can *at least* begin to formulate the kinds of questions that we might ask of a respiratory physiologist and breathwork specialist an intelligent question about improving our own breathwork practice.

We can use AI to pick up where others have left off and build upon our practice in breathwork. As our practice deepens, we can broaden our knowledge by asking more questions of our AI assistants.

### Develop HYBRID intelligence

The basic strategy is to ask an AI for a basic roadmap or overall view of a topic, then we drive forward by implementing our understanding with our own very basic practice ... but we don't really LEARN something until we have done it or taught it to ourselves ... after we have deepened our knowledge **through our own practice**, we then ask an AI to elaborate further and to extend our base or broaden our knowledge, but we should stress that our knowledge does not *take root* until we have implemented it in our own practice.

When we are working on a larger topic like breathwork and respiratory physiology, we start by creating a [Claude AI project](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects) to get past cold starts and allow us to ground Claudeâ€™s outputs in our internal knowledge: style guides, codebases, interview transcripts, or past research and experimentation ... of course, we will add things like med school text and medical literature. As we are able to add digital context, we help to enable Claude to provide expert assistance across tasks in [breathwork, cardiovascular health, physiological oxygenation and neuroscience](https://claude.ai/project/b45f024a-5ae1-4075-9a4d-7e5e144da8e1)... the particular goal of this Claude AI project is for us to become more sustainably cognitively healthy, but, course, that depends upon being sustainably physiologically more healthy over all. The purpose of this project is to understand oxygenation, cardiovascular health, exercise/diet and especially the role that a variety of breathwork exercises play in cognitive health.

EXTENDED breath cycles have profound effects on the body and the mind ... it's **ABSOLUTELY NOT** magic or anything remotely like something having to do with sacred texts or ancient hidden occult practices of shamans and priests, ie *that's just marketing or anti-marketing* ... ***EXTENDED BREATH CYCLES ARE JUST SIMPLE [or relatively simple] BIOCHEMISTRY and THE NEUROSCIENCE OF THE BRAIN WHICH AN ORGAN THAT IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN BLOOD BIOCHEMISTRY,*** ie *so either extra oyxgen or oxygen deprivation might indeed* ***feel*** *like it's magic.*

Longer, extended breath retentions are all about increasing CO2 tolerance, as well as potentially improving oxygen utilization efficiency. Extended exhalations activate the parasympathetic nervous system more strongly, physiologically deepening the relaxation response and the perceived effect can seem even more powerful, especially if one has programmed oneself to ***believe*** that it is more powerful. 

Because of the tendency of uninitiated noobs to extrapolate and even abuse what they believe to be newfound super powers, it is crucial to note that **these advanced techniques should be approached gradually!**

Extending the breath cycle too quickly will lead to lightheadedness or anxiety.

Practitioners should *go slow*, "you have the rest of your life left to practice -- so don't let your practice make you unconscious or dead."  As in all forms of exercise, it is particularly true in breathwork, to listen to your body and progress more slowly, more sustainably ...  ideally, if possible, under the guidance of an experienced teacher.

Many of these techniques also incorporate visualization or physical movements, integrating breathwork with broader mind-body practices. A more holistic approach can generally reinforce the effects of the breath work, promoting greater awareness, energy regulation, and overall well-being ... but, we always should take a euphoric blast of sunshine up our asses with a grain of salt.

AFTER you have practiced ... practice means at least, 30X per item per day for at least a week ... probably will have a sufficient understanding of how these work in order to engineer a better prompt or ask a smarter question of your favorite AI agents in order to delve more deeply or elaborate on these specific techniques or the physiological aspect of different extended breath cycles.
