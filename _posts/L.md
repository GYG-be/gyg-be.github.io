## L. Whole-Person Wellness

Prioritizing holistic health by integrating spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. This involves nurturing a strong relationship with God through prayer, Bible study, and worship, seeking emotional healing and support through biblical counseling or trusted Christian community, and maintaining physical health through exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. This integrated approach recognizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of human life and seeks to honor God with every part of one's being.
