[Place **Your Heart** in God - Bishop Barron Sunday Sermon](https://youtu.be/TvRjwrmMUYo?si=bM9dEya37-hsXWA5]

Bishop Barron's message is about drawing out that basic feature of biblical spirituality—namely, the ordering of the heart, that deepest organizing principle of one’s entire life, TOWARD the Creator and TOWARD what the Creator intended you TO BECOME, from this point on ... stop living in regret, instead ponder the question *What* ***kind of a person*** *do I want TO BECOME?*
