## Z. Using AI to Better Program Myself

*Way back in 2024* ... well, ***EARLY*** 2024, this was written in late 2024, so it's different ... AI ***was*** not that all that great, yet ... but NOW, in late 2024 ... WOW! ... it's whole a different story. 

I am using a wide variety of AI resources to generate deep thought provoking questions ... a lot have been and still are self-referrential AI questions about AI/ML algorithms, AI resources, AI-driven IDEs, AI-enhanced dev tools and AI workflows ... but mostly, my AI-assisted question asking has gravitated toward the topic of programming myself ... because I guess I am not *THAT* particularly interested in using AI for code or regurgitating clever code snippets from all of the code libraries produced by humankind, and ***somebody else is doing that.*** *And, they are totally crushing it ... so it's good to have AI to keep up with it!* So instead of delving into something like SourceGraph [Code Intelligence](https://sourcegraph.com/code-search) or an AI-first IDE like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/blog) or Claude [Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), *which are GREAT tools!* ... I am GRATEFUL for the development in these coding tools, because I get why productivity in dev tools is huge ... 

But MOSTLY, I am trying to do a better job of programming ME. The best way to do this is for me to THINK, and not to waste any time thinking about stupid shit ... so I use commentaries and [questions sites](https://www.gotquestions.net/admin/BackendSubmit/RandomPage?websiteid=1) ... but mostly I ask AI a lot of questions that go way beyond what search engines used to provide *way back in 2024*.

I get that it consumes a few extra kilowatts, but not that many for an individual's questions -- largely, because someone else has asked, is asking, or will ask the same questions -- it's remarkably easy for the advanced AI we have now to pull the most relevant ones from  or generate other questions from the vast array of blogs, essays, wiki, commentary, scripture, ancient texts and other materials that have been digitized and are now part of the interwebs and ***then***, on top of that, the AI might even round out the list *hallucinating* some new WTF questions that have not actually been *frequently asked* to the point of being cliche or classical questions.

Toward that end, I find that benefit from multiple screenfuls of Questions ... 10 or 25 or 50 are not enough ... that's why I ask for at least 100 Questions on various Objectives ... for me to THINK about ... not to answer but to ponder on my walks OR ask the different search engines indexing the interwebs about ... the answers that come back from the interwebs are a broad array of deep, essential, Classical questions, ie the search engines do a pretty decent job of returning the answers with heaviest backlinks ... so I can explore ideas that humans have been asking themselves for a few thousand years, at least ... 

It do it this way, instead of succumbing to a personal version of *writers block,* or WORSE ... like just watching YouTube videos or recommender engine's shorts ... which leads to me thinking about not-so-random stupid distracting shit ... which was ***active-measure-engineered*** for the purpose of distract humans, to make them stupid consumer slaves or hate-filled weaponized zombies ... I can get my screenfuls of 100s of questions and then ask more questions to request deeper questions about the questions from AI resources, ie Claude, Grok, Copilot Gemini, DeekSeek, et al. ... so get a handle on which AI resources actually are resisting the ***active-measure-engineering*** media-manipulation game *which some have actually fallen into...*

I am treating ALL of AI as if it existed to benefit ME ... which is the ONLY thing I need it to do ... AI is all about BETTER programming me to be a more useful agent of bringing the Creator's Will into existence. It doesn't really cost that much or use that many resources, ie other people are already asking similar questions. The exercise boils down to a simple question: *What might I be missing?* OR *What might I have forgotten about?" 

Here's MY background ... I am a farmer, economist, multidisciplinary engineer with at least 60 years of hands-on experience figuring out how to use technology to get something done. 

To a small degree, I think about ANY technology ... like AI, for instance ... in terms of what that technology is, how technology becomes an organic living entity after interaction with human beings ... so I think about technologies as ecoystems and what those ecoystems are good for in terms of human use and serving humanity, in the same manner of how a responsible farmer thinks about soil building and land productivity, not just for the purpose of soil building itself, but for better soil quality, for better fitness of purpose for soil, in order growing greater yields of future crops of whatever is in future demand. AI is certainly not the ONLY technological ecosystem -- it's just one that I find particularly relevant, but there have been other technological ecoystems and there will be others. AI is an example.  

To a greater degree, I also measure the performance of technologies as an economist or investors in terms of how much traction they have in terms of eliminating constraints for other human beings, eg a company like NVIDIA was not interesting to me when I believed that the story was primarily about computer games -- it changed when the story became about being radically more efficient about matrix algebra and doing computations that eliminate the constraints of developers seeking to improve the lot of human kind -- I should have seen the parallels between gamers playing in simulated realms and developers/scientists working the realm of science and engineering, but I completely missed that point about matrix algebra and compute. I am certain that completely missing analogous points right now, but I'd argue that one can safely ignore what populations of humans who are intent on distracting themselves with games or drugs or bad habits want.   

To the greatest degree, as a multi-disciplinary engineer and someone who has always used technologies to SOLVE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS, I think about technologies like AI as tools ... tools for a human-benefiting end, but NOT as an end in/of themselves. AI isn’t just neutral—no tool ever is!  AI is a reflection of the intentions baked into its design. If AI engineers, developers, technologists, early adopters and prosumers leading opinions of technologies fail to seize command of their technological tools, the tendency is for these things to slide into dystopian territory, manipulating us like Orwell’s telescreens or drowning us in distractions like TV/cable/YouTube became, ie 500 million channels and nothing on. But by embedding human agency, transparency, privacy, value, and ethics into their work, developers can make AI a tool that genuinely benefits humanity IF THEY CAN FIND WAYS TO MAKE THE TOOL BENEFIT THEMSELVES FIRST. It’s not just about writing code anymore—we almost live in a no-code or post-code world, where AI agents can do much of the work of writing code—but we certainly are not completely there yet. Developing and USING the technology is bout choosing a conscience-driven path that ensures AI lifts us up rather than holding us down ... yeah, that sounds like a cliche, but it's kinda that simple.
