## U. Confidence, Courage and Humility

*Let's talk about building the* ***courage muscle*** ... or better yet, **humility is the best way to flex one's courage and confidence.**

Balancing humility with boldness, recognizing personal dependence on God while trusting in His power and promises. This involves acknowledging personal weaknesses and limitations, while also recognizing the gifts and talents that God has given. It also means being willing to take risks for the Kingdom, trusting that God will provide the strength and resources needed to succeed. This humble confidence reflects a deep trust in God's ability and a willingness to be used by Him for His purposes.
