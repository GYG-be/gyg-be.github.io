## R. Spiritual Fortitude

Where does LEGIT courage come from? Does it come from the growling wolf? Of course not, humans are at the apex of apex predators. What makes human courage greater than raw animal courage? The answer, of course, is spiritual fortitude. Developing resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity, trusting in God's strength and faithfulness. This involves cultivating a strong prayer life, immersing oneself in Scripture, and seeking support from fellow believers. It also means learning from trials, recognizing God's hand in difficult circumstances, and choosing to trust Him even when circumstances are uncertain. This steadfast faith reflects a deep understanding of God's sovereignty and a commitment to follow Him regardless of the cost.
