## C. Servant Leadership

Serve first! Serve first to imitate and fully adore the mysteries of Christ's example of servant leadership. In this case, we can lead best by following Christ's example. Prioritize the needs of others and using personal influence to empower and uplift those around you. This involves actively seeking opportunities to serve in the church, community, and workplace, while demonstrating humility, compassion, and a genuine desire to help others grow and succeed. It also means fostering healthy relationships built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to serving God and others.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Adoring and Understanding The Mysteries of Christ's Example

1. **How does Christ's washing of the disciples' feet challenge my concept of leadership? What does it mean, in terms of ideas of leadership that Jesus is the One who provides practical examples of forgiveness and cleansing?**

   - [John 13:1-17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-1.html) - "Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end..." Jesus demonstrated the ultimate servant leadership by performing what was typically a slave's task. This act powerfully redefined leadership as service rather than domination.

   - [Philippians 2:5-8](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html) - "Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped..." This passage reveals that Jesus' servant leadership wasn't merely a strategy but flowed from His divine nature. True leadership begins with the humility to empty oneself and take the form of a servant, regardless of status.

2. **The Passion of Christ inspires me, but what specific examples of Jesus' servant leadership most deeply challenge me? What am I just not quite capable of doing?**

   - [Mark 10:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/10/Mark-10-45.html) - "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus' willingness to sacrifice not just His dignity but His very life sets a standard of servant leadership that challenges our self-preservation instincts.

   - [Luke 22:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/22/Luke-22-27.html) - "For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves." At the Last Supper—a moment when Jesus could have demanded special treatment—He instead emphasized His servant role, challenging our desire for recognition and privilege.

   - [Matthew 20:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-28.html) - "Even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This passage reinforces that the heart of Jesus' mission was service culminating in sacrifice, challenging our tendency to seek power and position.

3. **How did Jesus balance authority and service in His ministry? Why did the vast majority of the effort go toward service, i.e., He didn't do this just to be a nice guy -- why does service give more power than grasping for authority?**

   - [Matthew 20:25-28](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/20/Matthew-20-25.html) - "But Jesus called them to him and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you...'" Jesus explicitly contrasts worldly authority structures with His kingdom's approach. His teachings show that genuine authority flows from service, not force.

   - [John 13:3-5](https://www.bibleref.com/John/13/John-13-3.html) - "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper..." Jesus washed feet precisely when He was most conscious of His divine authority, demonstrating that true power is expressed through humble service.

   - [Philippians 2:5-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-5.html) - "...he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death... Therefore God has highly exalted him..." This passage reveals the divine pattern: exaltation follows humble service. Jesus' authority was magnified through service, not diminished.

4. **What does it mean to "fully adore the mysteries of Christ's example" in my leadership? How do the Catholic rituals that are about adoration help me to work at being better at adoration in my own life?**

   - [Colossians 1:15-20](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/1/Colossians-1-15.html) - "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation... that in everything he might be preeminent." This passage presents Christ's supremacy over all creation. Adoration begins with recognizing the magnificence of who Christ is, which then transforms our own leadership approach.

   - [Ephesians 3:14-19](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/3/Ephesians-3-14.html) - "...that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge..." Authentic adoration stems from being overwhelmed by Christ's immeasurable love, which then flows into our service to others.

   - [Revelation 5:12-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/5/Revelation-5-12.html) - "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!" Adoration involves recognizing Christ's worthiness because of His sacrificial service, which becomes the model for our own leadership.

5. **How did Jesus empower and push His disciples rather than just doing things for them or creating dependency?**

   - [Matthew 10:5-15](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/10/Matthew-10-5.html) - "These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them... 'As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven has come near."'" Jesus delegated significant responsibility to His disciples, sending them to preach and heal independently, fostering their growth as leaders.

   - [Luke 10:1-12](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/10/Luke-10-1.html) - "After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two..." Jesus expanded His empowerment beyond the twelve, providing clear instructions but allowing autonomy in ministry, demonstrating trust in those He led.

   - [John 14:12-14](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-12.html) - "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do..." Jesus promised His followers would do even greater works than He did, showing His intent was not to create dependency but to equip others for expanded ministry.

6. **What qualities of Christ's servant leadership am I most resistant to embodying? Why is forgiveness so hard for human beings?**

   - [Matthew 18:21-35](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/18/Matthew-18-21.html) - "Then Peter came up and said to him, 'Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?'" Jesus' parable of the unforgiving servant reveals our natural resistance to extending the forgiveness we've received, highlighting the stark contrast between divine and human perspectives on grace.

   - [Colossians 3:12-13](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html) - "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness...bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." This passage frames forgiveness not as optional but as a reflection of our new identity in Christ.

   - [Ephesians 4:31-32](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-31.html) - "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you." The forgiveness we struggle to embody is contrasted with the negativity that comes naturally, highlighting the supernatural nature of Christ-like forgiveness.

7. **How did Jesus maintain awareness and prioritize needs vs wants when many were pressing in on Him?**

   - [Mark 1:35-39](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-35.html) - "And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed...And he said to them, 'Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.'" Jesus maintained spiritual priorities through prayer and clear purpose, allowing Him to make decisions that sometimes surprised His followers.

   - [Luke 5:15-16](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/5/Luke-5-15.html) - "But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray." Despite increasing demands, Jesus prioritized communion with the Father, which informed His discernment between needs and mere wants.

   - [Matthew 14:13-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-13.html) - "Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them..." Jesus balanced His need for solitude with compassionate response to genuine need, demonstrating discernment in the moment.

8. **What was the relationship between Jesus' times of solitude and His servant leadership? Why is solitude a requirement for servant leadership; why isn't just being a constantly hustling busybody enough?**

   - [Mark 1:35](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-35.html) - "And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed." Jesus prioritized solitude with the Father before engaging in ministry, establishing the pattern that effective service flows from spiritual communion.

   - [Luke 5:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/5/Luke-5-16.html) - "But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray." The habitual nature of Jesus' withdrawals suggests solitude was not incidental but essential to His ministry, providing the spiritual foundation for His service.

   - [Matthew 14:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/14/Matthew-14-23.html) - "And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray." Even after intense ministry, Jesus sought solitude, demonstrating that spiritual renewal is necessary after service, not just before.

   - [Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/11/Matthew-11-28.html) - "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest..." Jesus' invitation suggests that rest and communion with Him are essential counterbalances to service, preventing burnout and maintaining spiritual perspective.

9. **How did Jesus maintain boundaries while being the ultimate servant leader?**

   - [Luke 4:42-44](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-42.html) - "And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place...the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them, but he said to them, 'I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well...'" Jesus respectfully declined requests that didn't align with His mission, demonstrating that servant leadership includes maintaining clear boundaries.

   - [Mark 1:35-38](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-35.html) - "And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, and they found him and said to him, 'Everyone is looking for you.' And he said to them, 'Let us go on to the next towns...'" Jesus didn't allow others' expectations to dictate His movements, showing that servant leadership requires freedom from people-pleasing.

   - [John 6:14-15](https://www.bibleref.com/John/6/John-6-14.html) - "When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, 'This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!' Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself." Jesus withdrew when others sought to define His role in ways that contradicted His mission, demonstrating the importance of maintaining identity boundaries.

10. **What does Christ's willingness to suffer for others teach me about servant leadership?**

    - [1 Peter 2:21-24](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-21.html) - "For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps..." Christ's suffering was not merely endured but purposeful, teaching that servant leadership may require sacrificial suffering for the good of others.

    - [Hebrews 12:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/12/Hebrews-12-1.html) - "...looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross..." Jesus' endurance through suffering was motivated by anticipated joy, suggesting that servant leadership's sacrifices are sustained by eternal perspective.

    - [Isaiah 53:4-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-4.html) - "Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows..." This prophetic passage reveals that Christ's suffering was substitutionary, teaching that authentic servant leadership may involve bearing burdens that rightfully belong to others.

### Heart Posture and Motivation

11. **What motivates my desire to lead—recognition, impact, obligation, or service?**

    - [Philippians 2:3-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-3.html) - "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others." This passage challenges self-centered motivations for leadership, establishing others-focused service as the biblical standard.

    - [1 Peter 5:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-2.html) - "Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock." Peter specifically addresses leadership motivations, contrasting proper (willingness, eagerness, exemplary) with improper (compulsion, greed, domination) motivations.

    - [Galatians 5:13](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-13.html) - "For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another." The ultimate motivation for leadership should be love expressed through service, not self-gratification.

12. **How do I distinguish between serving from genuine love versus duty or guilt?**

    - [1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/13/1-Corinthians-13-1.html) - "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal..." Paul emphasizes that even the most impressive spiritual activities are worthless without love, suggesting that motivation matters more than appearance.

    - [2 Corinthians 9:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/9/2-Corinthians-9-7.html) - "Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." While speaking specifically about giving, this principle applies to all service—authentic service flows from cheerful willingness, not obligation.

    - [1 John 4:19-21](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-19.html) - "We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar..." Genuine love-motivated service flows from experiencing God's love first, distinguishing it from duty-driven service that lacks this foundation.

13. **What does humility look like in my particular leadership context?**

    - [Proverbs 22:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/22/Proverbs-22-4.html) - "The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life." This proverb links humility with reverence for God, suggesting that authentic humility begins with proper perspective on God's greatness and our dependence.

    - [James 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-10.html) - "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you." This verse reveals the counterintuitive pattern of God's kingdom—self-exaltation leads to humiliation, while humility leads to being lifted up by God.

    - [1 Peter 5:5-6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-5.html) - "Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.' Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you." Peter presents humility as something we must intentionally "put on," suggesting it requires conscious choice rather than simply following natural inclination.

14. **How do I handle the tension between confidence in my abilities and humility in my approach?**

    - [2 Corinthians 12:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-9.html) - "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses..." Paul resolves this tension by finding confidence in God's power working through acknowledged weakness, not self-sufficiency.

    - [Jeremiah 9:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Jeremiah/9/Jeremiah-9-23.html) - "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me..." This passage redirects confidence from personal abilities to relationship with God.

    - [Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html) - "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding..." This familiar proverb frames humility as dependence on God rather than self, suggesting that true confidence comes from trusting God's guidance.

15. **What aspects of pride most hinder my effectiveness as a servant leader?**

    - [Proverbs 16:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-18.html) - "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This proverb warns that pride leads to downfall, suggesting that it undermines the stability and sustainability of leadership.

    - [Isaiah 66:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/66/Isaiah-66-2.html) - "But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word." God's attention and favor are directed toward the humble, suggesting that pride creates distance from the divine resources needed for effective leadership.

    - [Galatians 6:3-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-3.html) - "For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself..."

16. **How do I maintain pure motives when service brings recognition or appreciation?**

    - [Matthew 6:1-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-1.html) - "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven..."

    - [Colossians 3:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-23.html) - "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ." This passage reframes all service as primarily for Christ, which helps maintain pure motives regardless of human response.

    - [1 Thessalonians 2:3-6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/2/1-Thessalonians-2-3.html) - "For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive... nor did we seek glory from people..." Paul describes his ministry as free from manipulative motives or desire for human approval, providing a model for pure-hearted service.

17. **What practices help me maintain a genuine heart of compassion toward those I lead?**

    - [Colossians 3:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html) - "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience." This passage depicts compassion as something we must intentionally "put on," suggesting it requires deliberate cultivation rather than simply following natural feelings.

    - [Ephesians 4:32](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-32.html) - "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you." This verse roots compassion in personal experience of God's grace, suggesting that maintaining compassion requires ongoing awareness of our own need for mercy.

    - [1 Peter 3:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-8.html) - "Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind." Peter links compassion with other relational virtues, suggesting that it flourishes in the context of healthy community rather than isolation.

18. **How do I respond internally when my service goes unnoticed or unappreciated?**

    - [Colossians 3:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-23.html) - "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward." This passage redirects our expectation of recognition from humans to God, who sees all service and rewards faithfulness.

    - [Galatians 6:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-9.html) - "And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up."

    - [Hebrews 6:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/6/Hebrews-6-10.html) - "For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints..." This verse reassures us that God notices and remembers service that humans may overlook, providing comfort when appreciation is lacking.

19. **What signs indicate that my leadership is becoming self-serving rather than others-focused?**

    - [Philippians 2:21](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-21.html) - "For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ." Paul identifies self-interest as the opposite of Christ-like service, suggesting that prioritizing personal benefit over kingdom advancement indicates self-serving leadership.

    - [James 3:14-16](https://www.bibleref.com/James/3/James-3-14.html) - "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth... For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice." James reveals that self-serving leadership produces recognizable negative fruit—jealousy, disorder, and various harmful practices.

    - [Ezekiel 34:2-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezekiel/34/Ezekiel-34-2.html) - "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel... 'Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?'" God directly condemns leaders who exploit their position for personal gain while neglecting those entrusted to their care.

20. **How do I balance healthy self-care with selfless service to others?**

    - [Mark 6:30-32](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/6/Mark-6-30.html) - "The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them, 'Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.'" Jesus models healthy self-care by encouraging rest after ministry, suggesting that sabbath rhythms are essential for sustainable service.

    - [1 Kings 19:3-8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/19/1-Kings-19-3.html) - "Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life... But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness... And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, 'Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.'" God's care for Elijah's physical and emotional needs during ministry burnout demonstrates divine affirmation of legitimate self-care.

    - [Ecclesiastes 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/4/Ecclesiastes-4-6.html) - "Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind."

### Identifying and Meeting Needs

21. **How can I become more attentive to the unspoken needs of those around me?**

    - [Philippians 2:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-4.html) - "Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."

Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth." John connects authentic love with both seeing needs and responding to them, indicating that attentiveness requires both perception and action.

    - [Proverbs 31:8-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/31/Proverbs-31-8.html) - "Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy." This proverb highlights advocacy for those who cannot speak for themselves, suggesting that true attentiveness includes recognizing when others lack voice or representation.

22. **What practices help me listen deeply enough to understand others' true needs?**

    - [James 1:19](https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-19.html) - "Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger." James prioritizes listening over speaking, suggesting that patient, controlled silence creates space for deeper understanding.

    - [Proverbs 20:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-5.html) - "The purpose in a man's heart is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out." This metaphor suggests that understanding others' true needs requires intentional effort, like drawing water from a deep well, rather than settling for surface impressions.

23. **How do I discern between meeting legitimate needs versus enabling unhealthy patterns?**

    - [2 Thessalonians 3:10](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/3/2-Thessalonians-3-10.html) - "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat." Paul establishes clear boundaries that discourage enabling dependency, suggesting that discernment requires distinguishing between inability and unwillingness.

    - [Proverbs 19:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/19/Proverbs-19-19.html) - "A man of great wrath will pay the penalty, for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again." This proverb warns against repeatedly rescuing someone from self-created problems, suggesting that allowing natural consequences can sometimes be more helpful than intervention.

    - [Galatians 6:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-1.html) - "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness... Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." Paul balances restoration with personal responsibility, suggesting that wise help addresses root issues rather than merely alleviating symptoms.

24. **What is the difference between what people want and what they truly need?**

    - [Philippians 4:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/4/Philippians-4-19.html) - "And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."

    - [Psalm 23:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/23/Psalm-23-1.html) - "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want." David experiences sufficiency in God's provision despite not having everything he might desire, indicating that true needs are satisfied in relationship with the Shepherd who knows what sustains his sheep.

25. **How do I prioritize competing needs when I cannot meet them all?**

    - [Galatians 6:9-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-9.html) - "And let us not grow weary of doing good...
