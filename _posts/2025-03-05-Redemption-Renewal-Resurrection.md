Lent is about letting go of stuff, not being captivated or held hostage by something, perhaps something from the past ... it's really about symbolically participating in the mystery of Jesus Christ ... moving on from desires for comfort and convenience, moving on from any addiction to things that make us temporarily feel good, brushing off the decay and rust and getting ready to shine.

We do that at Lent ... because the best holiday of the year, Easter and Resurrection Sunday is only 40 Lenten days [of special fasting and almsgiving] away ... Sundays are not counted, since they are treated as days of celebration ... but the number of 40 for fast days has all kinds of significance. The [number 40 especially signifies different periods of testing or preparation in the Bible](https://biblechat.ai/knowledgebase/religious-events-symbols/biblical-symbols/how-many-times-number-40-mentioned-bible/), but the most important [in a Lenten sense] context or narrative might be the 40 days Jesus spent fasting and being tempted in the desert (Matthew 4:1-11).  It was also 40 days after the Resurrection until the Ascension. There are plenty of other mentions, the 40 days/nights of rain in the Flood; also goes back to Moses spending 40 days/40 nights on Mount Sinai recieving the Ten Commandments, or Moses's 40 years in the desert as a shepherd before leading the Hebrews on the Exodus and then, the Hebrews spending 40 more years in the wilderness before Joshua led them into the Promised Land.

The 40 days of Lent are an especially special opportunity for Christians, but it is this 40 day period of more intense contemplation of what Jesus's sacrifice was to mean ... and, Christians can soak this in every year in the 40 days before Easter, or for the season of Lent [while getting the celebrations on Sunday] ... *the gains come out of what is taken away* ... so Lent is thus a period of more intense reflection and spiritual adoration of Jesus Christ. Adoration of Jesus Christ and contemplation of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ begins with the symbolism of letting go of the past, letting go of the rust and decay and past desires, moving on to becoming better disciple of Christ.
