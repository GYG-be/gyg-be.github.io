Holy Hour is about earnest, humble prayer of profound GRATITUDE ... it's a celebration of the possibilities and boundy before us ... it's not about praying about your worries, your needs, your wants or the worries, needs, wants of others ... Holy Hour is strictly about an hour of prayerful GRATITUDE and celebration.
# Gratitude HAS TO define your day. EVERY day.

ESPECIALLY on those days when you imagine that you're having a hard time thinking of something to be grateful for.

Of course, you could just start with the fact that you're alive and the other things that you have journalled about being grateful for before ... but that's not really going to be good enough ... EVERY SINGLE DAY you need to be grateful for something NEW, something you have not really thought about before.

There will be something NEW ... EVERY SINGLE DAY ... and you will need to develop the discipline of thinking of something NEW every day to be grateful for.

When we say that "***Gratitude HAS TO define your day.***", we mean that you need to have the discipline of waking up knowing that **you OWE your Creator a genuine expression of gratitude and thanks for something new every day.**

remember the best practices for gratitude journaling:

**Set a Regular Schedule:** Start EVERY DAY at 4 AM ... to write something in your journal, even if what you write is that you can't think of anything, write what's one your mind ... but get going in the morning to start your day positively, knowing that as the day evolves you will be able to reflect on the starting point of your day.

**Be Specific:** Instead of general statements like "I'm grateful for my family," specify what you appreciate about them, such as "I'm grateful for my sister's support during a tough time."

**Limit Your Entries:** Most of the time, you need to focus on just ONE new items each day to encourage deeper reflection rather than a long list which will become superficial and some brainstormed laundry list that an AI could have written.

**Use Prompts:** Incorporate prompts and things like Momentum Plus "a" hotkey for Ask AI to inspire your writing ... it's not a human, so you can ask any stupid question without worrying about what the AI thinks.

**Push Yourself With Challenges:** Acknowledge difficult, painful experiences or anxieties and identify any lessons learned or growth that came from them, fostering a more balanced perspective.

**Do NOT Reflect on the Past:** Your mind will drift back to your teenage or college years enough without being prompted. If the past has traumas that will not leave you alone, it can be okay to occasionally write about past experiences or people you are grateful for, which can deepen your appreciation for what you have overcome and your connection to others facing similar adversities in your history ... but MOSTLY, you will be better off if you reflect on the possibilities that might be possible now in the future which weren't possible until now.

**Incorporate Different Mediums:** Experiment with various formats, such as doodling with colored pencils, collaging, or even recording audio entries, to keep the practice engaging.

**Express Emotions:** Donâ€™t just list items; describe how they make you feel. This enhances emotional connection and reinforces positive feelings.

**Review Regularly:** Periodically read back through your entries to remind yourself of the positive aspects of your life and track your growth over time.

**Stay Consistent but Flexible:** While consistency is key, allow yourself the flexibility to skip days or change your approach as needed to keep the practice enjoyable and meaningful.

**Develop your OWN best practices:** You own experience will help you enhance your gratitude journaling experience and cultivate a more PRODUCTIVE mindset for those things where productivity matters to YOU.

## The thing that you are grateful for each day must be NEW, but does not need to be something extraordinary that wins a Nobel Prize
