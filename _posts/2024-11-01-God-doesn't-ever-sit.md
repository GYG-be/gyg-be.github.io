# What Does "I AM" Mean?

In Exodus 3:14 God reveals to Moses that GOD *is* **I AM**  ... or "I CREATE what I create [*which is everything*] ... so God is EVERYTHING that is happening as the entire creation of every last physical thing [in this Universe and all others] and every last natural law governing every last physical unfolds.

We should be clear ... I AM is definitional, it's a matter of DEFINITION of terms or names ... the I AM that we believe in is ***EVERYTHING that is happening as the entire creation of every last physical thing [in this Universe and all others] and every last natural law governing every last physical unfolds.***  Our name, that we commonly use for ***I AM*** is *just* the simple, three-letter word, "God."

We can infer that, I AM ... or אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה‎ ... the *name* that God uses to explain to humans when God explains what God is ... means that God ***IS*** CREATION ...and everything in creation. 

## Instead of thinking about a fixed OBJECT, we should think about a PROCESS

Of course, the problem is that we can't even really use words to describe this ... but the best we can do is to realize that creation is a continual ongoing process [which we are part of] ... but it is also something that we can witness and participate in.

God is maybe our best example of CREATIVE [***flow***](https://youtu.be/7dSzKnf5WWg) ... by being in a state of FLOW, we mean that God is not at all like a struggling, possibly mentally ill, frustrated artist ... but rather infinitely productive over a vast realm and immensely positive and loving and constantly encouraging of the creativity of His created beings ... of course, this also means that God is not remotely as sedentary as human beings are or lazy humans tend to become. 

**God doesn't EVER sit!!!** There's nothing about God that gives us any indication that laziness is ok ... REST is fine on the day of rest, the other six days are for getting after it.
