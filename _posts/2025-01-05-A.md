This aligns decisions with scriptural principles and fosters a lifestyle that reflects obedience and love for God. It's important to recognize how this first objective drives all objectives and how how all other objectives are in support of this most primary of all primary objectives.

# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Foundation and Understanding
1. What does "putting God first" mean to me **personally**, in my practical daily routine or weekly planning sessions, beyond *just* the theological concept?
