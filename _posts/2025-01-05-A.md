## A. Putting God First

This objective has to be THE priority that drives all othes. Prioritizing a deep understanding of God's will in every facet of life. This involves actively seeking His guidance through consistent and sincere prayer, studying and applying biblical wisdom, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and trusting the Holy Spirit's leading. This aligns decisions with scriptural principles and fosters a lifestyle that reflects obedience and love for God. It's important to recognize how this first objective drives all objectives and how how all other objectives are in support of this most primary of all primary objectives.

# Two Example Questions With Scripture and Commentary To Illustrate Desired Format of Response

1. **How does Scripture's view of humans as integrated whole spiritual beings, but differ from the materialist modern perspectives?**
   
   - [1 Thessalonians 5:23](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-23.html) - "May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your WHOLE ***1)*** spirit, **2)** soul and *3)* body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." *Notice the order; the order tells us that the material perspective comes last OR, more accurately, is in service of or subject to the preceding priorities, ie body serves soul, soul and body serve spiritual essence.

   - [Mark 12:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-30.html) - "Love **the Lord your God** with ***all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength***." We are to love our Creator, giving that love FIRST priority; we are to love all others as we love ourselves, but that is a SECOND priority. "Heart" is from the Greek root word kardia, and means the center of one's life, whether physical, spiritual, or mental. The heart drives one's beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and intentions. "Soul" is from the Greek root word psychÄ“ which is similar to the heart, but focuses on the vital force that keeps us alive. "Mind" is not found in the original Old Testament quote (Deuteronomy 6:5, see below), but is certainly appropriate to add for an audience influenced by more logical Greek culture. It comes from the Greek root word dianoia and, again, has a similar definition to heart but with a more mental bent.
   
   - [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-5.html) - "Love **the LORD your God** with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." Verse like this show me why the Bible is so important to study, because of how it is about evolvution of culture and mindsets over 1000s of years. The fact that mind is not included here illustrates something about how the ancient saw life as primarily a matter of defined by heart and soul and strength; in other words, the human experience was not yet intellectual or dedicated to the mind or anything remotely similar to having a socratic or platonic or aristotelian or philosophic influence of any kind. The ancients were extremely simple, much less capable in many ways, but were much less neurotic, self-obsessed and meta-cognitive than we moderns are. At the time Deuteronomy was written, the concept of "mind" would have been almost unknown or perhaps, if it was known, seen as being "New Agey" or as futuristic speculative proto-Greek bs and and not to be trusted. The life of the mind has been a tremendous blessing to humanity. Our consumption of knowledge has defined how we think about developing ourselves, how we order and plan our lives and it has certainly given us the ability to think about abstract principles and thus solve problems that humans could not begin to even contemplate in an ancient world -- just as texts, priests, scriptures changed the minds and then lives and capabilities and ability to reason of the ancients, programattic knowledge we see in AI and knowledge engineering will similarly transform humans as we go forward, AS THE CREATOR CLEARLY INTENDED.

2. **What biblical examples demonstrate the ancient's better interconnection between spiritual, mental, and physical well-being?**

   - [Proverbs 4:20-22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-22.html) - "My son, pay attention to what I say; *turn your ear to my words* [ie, Solomon tells his son, to "do as I say, not as I do"]. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body." Discerning the WILL of the Creator, including for one's own time mgmt priorities, exercise, diet, sleep, sobriety, overall well-being, coming up with a plan and then consistently sticking with ***"the plan"*** is the way to avoid unnecessary, foreseeable disaster.

   - [3 John 1:2](https://www.bibleref.com/3-John/1/3-John-1-2.html) - "***Beloved***, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul." The apostle John was quite old by the time he wrote this letter to his dear Christian friend Gaius who was of a similar age. "*As it goes well with your soul*" is a gentle reminder to Gaius, a contemporary of John's, who knew [but maybe needed a gentle reminder] that physical health, or one's ability to deal with severely declining physical health, derives from, or is of secondary importance to, spiritual health. The interconnections is definitely NOT a matter of equivalence or trade-offs; there is a priority to what must come first.

   - [Psalm 103:1-5](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/103/Psalm-103-5.html) - "Praise the LORD, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name... who ***satisfies you with good*** so that your youth is renewed like the eagle 's." It's important to remember that "good" is something defined according to God's perfect wisdom (Isaiah 55:8), not ours. Everything God has created has a good purpose (1 Timothy 4:4), even if we cannot fully understand all things.


# 100 Questions for Contemplation

### Foundation and Understanding
1. What does "putting God first" mean to me **personally**, in my practical daily routine or weekly planning sessions, beyond *just* the theological concept? *(Matthew 6:33, Proverbs 3:5-6)*

2. How has my understanding of God's primacy in my life evolved over time? How have I changed or grown? Have I even begun to change enough? *(Philippians 3:12-14, 2 Corinthians 3:18)*

3. What Biblical [or historical] figures exemplify putting God first OR possibly failing to put God first ... and what can I learn from their good and bad examples? *(Hebrews 11, 1 Corinthians 10:6-11)*

4. When I Examen my daily schedule or attempt to understand where/why I drift off tract, what does it reveal about my true priorities or my inadequacies in meeting my objectives, especially the objective of Putting God First? *(Psalm 139:23-24, Lamentations 3:40)*

5. How do I discern between God's will and my own desires when they seem aligned? Can I guard against my ego's confirmation bias OR are humans condemned to the depravity of ego-driven desires that are not of the Kingdom of Heaven? *(Romans 12:2, 1 John 4:1)*

6. How do I recognize when my desires are actually in conflict with God's will? Is fasting or renunciation of comfort/convenience an aid or an impediment? *(James 4:1-3, Matthew 6:16-18)*

7. What spiritual practices have most effectively helped me prioritize God in my life? Where have the shortfalls in my practice been? How do I prioritize the prioritization or repetition of what works? *(1 Timothy 4:7-8, Colossians 3:1-2)*

8. What does it mean to love God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength in practical terms? Again, does renunciation help this cause? *(Mark 12:30, Deuteronomy 6:5)*

9. How do I define success in my spiritual journey of putting God first? Faith is basically not amenable to quantization, but but what kinds of other things or indications can I measure and track that help the cause of coaching me in my practice? *(Galatians 5:22-23, 2 Peter 1:5-8)*

10. What Scripture passages most challenge me to examine my priorities? Do different arrays of suggested passages in support of questions help OR do they lead me off track. *(Hebrews 4:12, James 1:22-25)*

### Daily Rhythms and Practices
11. How do the **first** waking moments of my day reflect whether God is my priority? Why is getting up for my daily holy hour at 4 AM important to me? How do I keep it important? Why is keeping the Sabbath holy important to me, ***aside*** from it being one of the Ten Commandments? *(Psalm 5:3, Exodus 20:8-11)*

12. What practices could I implement and then better implement to revitalize, re-group, reorient my heart toward God throughout the day? *(Psalm 119:164, 1 Thessalonians 5:17)*

13. How can I better transform ordinary, routine activities and chores into opportunities for communion with God? *(Colossians 3:17, 1 Corinthians 10:31)*

14. What distractions most commonly pull me away from God-centered focus? Why do ideas to even think about these distractions cross my mind? What is the root cause of these addictive behaviors? How do I *cave in the melon* of the personal demons driving thoughts of these distractions to enter my mind? *(Hebrews 12:1-2, 2 Corinthians 10:5)*

15. Aside from [my weekly and daily routines as dictated by my boilerplate schedule](https://markbruns.github.io/Schedule), how might I better tailor my specific weekly for **each** week and daily schedules for **each** day with unique priorities for that day to reflect God's primacy? *([Ephesians 5:15-16](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/5/Ephesians-5-16.html). Although it is human nature to get caught up in the moment getting something done, when we are planning our time is wise have the perspective that each moment is a gift and each could be our last. [Psalm 90:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/90/Psalm-90-12.html) We ought to dedicate today and every day to the Lord. We must live sensibly and with a purpose, yet do so one day at a time.)*

16. What would a "holy hour" *look like* [sound like, smell like, taste like, feel like] that truly puts God first in my life? In other words, what is ***the vision*** that I have for tomorrow's holy hour, next week's, next month's, next year's, five or ten year from now? *([Matthew 6:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-6.html) Things like prayer are best when in secret; if the opinion of other people is the only motive, we can be sure that God will not reward such actions. Instead, Jesus commands His followers to treat prayer as his directions about giving personally to a needy individual, ie to do it as secretly as possible to maintain the dignity of the recipient and to avoid even the possibility of mixed motives from public actions. Conversely, in [Habakkuk 2:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Habakkuk/2/Habakkuk-2-2.html) we see that, for things that are best public, eg open source code, that can benefit many others, both now and in the future, it is best to ensure that these things are open and available to whoever can use the informtion.)*
