## A. Putting God First
This objective has to be THE priority that drives all othes. Prioritizing a deep understanding of God's will in every facet of life. This involves actively seeking His guidance through consistent and sincere prayer, studying and applying biblical wisdom, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and trusting the Holy Spirit's leading. This aligns decisions with scriptural principles and fosters a lifestyle that reflects obedience and love for God. It's important to recognize how this first objective drives all objectives and how how all other objectives are in support of this most primary of all primary objectives.

### Foundation and Understanding
1. **What does "putting God first" mean to me personally, in my practical daily routine or weekly planning sessions, beyond just the theological concept?**
- [Matthew 6:33](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html) - Jesus instructs us to "seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." This verse emphasizes that prioritizing God should come before all other concerns, including material needs.
- [Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-5.html) - "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." This passage reminds us that practical trust involves acknowledging God in all decisions, allowing divine wisdom rather than self-reliance to guide our planning and priorities.
2. **How has my understanding of God's primacy in my life evolved over time? How have I changed or grown? Have I even begun to change enough?**
- [Philippians 3:12-14](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/3/Philippians-3-12.html) - Paul acknowledges, "Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me." This verse recognizes spiritual growth as an ongoing process rather than a completed achievement, encouraging continued striving toward spiritual maturity.
- [2 Corinthians 3:18](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/3/2-Corinthians-3-18.html) - "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit." This passage describes spiritual transformation as progressive and continuous, occurring as we maintain our focus on Christ.
3. **What Biblical [or historical] figures exemplify putting God first OR possibly failing to put God first... and what can I learn from their good and bad examples?**
- [Hebrews 11](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/11/Hebrews-11.html) - Often called the "faith hall of fame," this chapter recounts numerous examples of biblical figures who demonstrated extraordinary faith despite difficult circumstances. These individuals prioritized God's commands and promises over immediate comfort or conventional wisdom.
- [1 Corinthians 10:6-11](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-6.html) - Paul explains that the failures of Israel in the wilderness "occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did." This passage emphasizes the instructional value of negative examples in Scripture, showing the consequences of misplaced priorities.
4. **When I Examen my daily schedule or attempt to understand where/why I drift off track, what does it reveal about my true priorities or my inadequacies in meeting my objectives, especially the objective of Putting God First?**
- [Psalm 139:23-24](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-23.html) - "Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." This prayer invites divine scrutiny of one's inner life, recognizing that self-examination often requires God's help to reveal hidden motives and patterns.
- [Lamentations 3:40](https://www.bibleref.com/Lamentations/3/Lamentations-3-40.html) - "Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD." This verse connects self-examination with repentance, suggesting that honest assessment of one's life should lead to renewed commitment to God.
5. **How do I discern between God's will and my own desires when they seem aligned? Can I guard against my ego's confirmation bias OR are humans condemned to the depravity of ego-driven desires that are not of the Kingdom of Heaven?**
- [Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html) - "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will." This verse suggests that spiritual discernment develops through mind renewal, enabling believers to recognize God's will even when it might resemble personal preferences.
- [1 John 4:1](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/4/1-John-4-1.html) - "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." This passage calls for spiritual testing and discernment, acknowledging the possibility of deception even in seemingly spiritual matters.
6. **How do I recognize when my desires are actually in conflict with God's will? Is fasting or renunciation of comfort/convenience an aid or an impediment?**
- [James 4:1-3](https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-1.html) - "What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight." This passage identifies selfish desires as the source of conflicts, providing a lens through which to examine motivations that may oppose God's will.
- [Matthew 6:16-18](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-16.html) - Jesus gives instructions on fasting, emphasizing sincerity and private devotion rather than public display. This suggests that spiritual disciplines like fasting can be valuable when practiced with pure motives, focusing on connection with God rather than external appearance.
7. **What spiritual practices have most effectively helped me prioritize God in my life? Where have the shortfalls in my practice been? How do I prioritize the prioritization or repetition of what works?**
- [1 Timothy 4:7-8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/4/1-Timothy-4-7.html) - "Train yourself to be godly. For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come."

- [Colossians 3:1-2](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-1.html) - "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things." This passage emphasizes the importance of intentionally directing one's thoughts and affections toward spiritual realities.
8. **What does it mean to love God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength in practical terms? Again, does renunciation help this cause?**
- [Mark 12:30](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/12/Mark-12-30.html) - "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength."

- [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/6/Deuteronomy-6-5.html) - "Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." This original commandment from the Torah establishes comprehensive love for God as foundational to the covenant relationship, calling for total devotion rather than compartmentalized religion.
9. **How do I define success in my spiritual journey of putting God first? Faith is basically not amenable to quantization, but what kinds of other things or indications can I measure and track that help the cause of coaching me in my practice?**
- [Galatians 5:22-23](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html) - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."

This progressive list of virtues suggests spiritual development occurs in stages, with each quality building upon previous ones.
10. **What Scripture passages most challenge me to examine my priorities? Do different arrays of suggested passages in support of questions help OR do they lead me off track?**
- [Hebrews 4:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-12.html) - "For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
