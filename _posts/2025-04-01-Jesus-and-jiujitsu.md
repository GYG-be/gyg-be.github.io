## WORK AT becoming stronger, more courageous, less afraid

This whole existence is all about [Joshua 1.9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/1-9-compare.html) ... of course, it's only human to have worries, fears, doubts, weaknesses ... don't just overlook or aggressively ignore these things ... don't be a brittle marionette ... acknowledge your humanity, acknowledge these different weaknesses and work at improving your discipline to overcome them with generally better training and courage building ... never stop WORKING ON YOUR DISCIPLINE.

# Why Bother Working On Your Discipline?

Working on your discipline is ONLY thing that you really have in this existence.

DISCIPLINE is freedom ... which also means you will never be free, there will always be something that you have to work on to improve your discipline.

To make a long story short ... you really don't ***have to*** work on your discipline ... you can just sorta coast, get more and more miserable and then eventually die.

If you just do not want to work on your discipline any more, you can completely *check out* ... that is an option.

Our work on our discipline is what defines our lives ... if you want to have a modicum of freedom, you must have discipline to fight and die fighting for what you believe in. Without discipline, there is no freedom ... you're just a product of some induced whim ... it's not just that you have zero control over your destiny -- you also have zero control over how you react to or handle situations. 

Time ... or specifically, the moments of THIS day are your only asset ... INVEST WISELY in order to get more value from the moments of tomorrow ... there is no positive return on investing your time in the past. Don't look back, we are not going that way.

How you use that TODAY'S time will determines the value of that asset FOR YOUR FUTURE VALUE.

You do not have and should not ever worry about maximizing your time's value for someone else -- you have to continually develop the discipline to make your time valuable to yourself, so that you can be an asset to others who matter, ie purely needy people who never grow up are never going to matter to anybody. **YOUR only chance at fulfillment and freedom in life is to** ***USE*** **your time in disciplined manner according to your values, goals and faith**. 

This is why we will repetitiously say over and over in the BIG WHY project that *it is up to YOU to* **define** your BIG WHY ... nobody can develop your discipline for you ... nobody else can or should timeblock and prioritize your day for you.*


# Healthy Habits Are NECESSARILY going to suck

It's necessary to do HARD, difficult things, but there's more to life. So I don't necessarily do hard things all day long and you shouldn't either [unless you have made bad life choices] ...YOUR MILEAGE WILL VARY ON THIS, but for me ... I have to spend about 1/3 of my waking day doing things that not impossibly hard, but of the kind that I would probably not otherwise do unless I prioritized them ... I also get to spend about 1/3 of my waking day just listening to audiobooks, thinking about nutrition/health, looking at recipes, thinking cooking and eating and what I can grow in the garden, starting plants and gardening, going for walks and seeing how my favorite Park is doing, checking up friends/family and sort of just generally being another decent-ish human being ... and I also GET TO SPEND about 1/3 of my waking day doing things that are serious, creative open source tech and sci fi pursuits, ie things that I WANT TO DO because I hope that they might be of benefit to others, but are not REQUIRED to produce results ... there is ZERO time devoted to things like drinking or hanging out with people who drink.

If you want to create things ... you have to start by creating yourself ... and you should understand, that when you really depart from faking life and start creating an original you, people [who ***just settle***] for just being spectators, just watching vids/teevee, just going along with the other tourists ... the people who ***SETTLE*** rather than create their own existences will let you know that they are displeased by you not being the person they knew before ... HEALTH HABITS are NECESSARILY going to suck and that includes all of the people [including your former self] who look at you and are TOTALLY SCARED of your creativity. 

It's HEALTHY to minimize the less than creative voices in your head. 

## Jesus and Jiujitsu ... Martial Arts Lifestyle

What follows is starting list of approximately 250 ideas behind comprehensive weekly martial arts training regimen … in addition to jiu jitsu for mobility and flexibility … it also includes knife throwing, slingshot, crossbow for training that is is training for archery, golf, pitching/passing but with greater emphasis on grip, dexterity, mobility, flexibility, balance and biomechanics motor control

### Sketch of Weekly Routine

Monday WOD: Focus on Grip and Finesse, Mental Rehearsal Exercises
Tuesday WOD: Strength and Conditioning, Breathwork, Meditation
Wednesday WOD: Precision and Distance, HumpDay Self-Coaching
Thursday WOD: Technique Variation, Breathwork, Mobility
Friday WOD: Speed, Execution, Reload Drills, Visualization
Saturday WOD: High Repetition Day, Emotional Regulation
Sunday REST: Recovery, Maintenance/5S Review, Reflection

### Diet, Nutrition, Gardening

Mostly, the best diet is to remove everything but ESSENTIALS … but especially we remove the foods that are engineered to taste good or that induce an addiction to sweetness, comfort or convenience. We want to taper off things like caffeine and generally avoid ever using food as comfort or something like an emotional companion or source of dopamine hits. We avoid any/all trips to restaurants, cafes, delis, convenience stores – it’s too hard to get ESSENTIALS when eating away for convenience or service; the providers have to make their food taste too good.

### Martial arts is about EFFICIENCY and MINIMALISM. 

In the realm of nutrition, MINIMALISM means that we pay more attention essentials such as ample filtered water for full hydration … we also want adequate or more than adequate animal protein consumption (red meat, dairy, eggs)  for muscle maintenance [which is particularly important for aged males, because of metabolism changes in 40s, 50s, 60s and thereafter],fresh vegetables from the garden, supplementation for likely deficiencies in magnesium, iodine, zinc, vitamin C/D, fish oil, [homemade with L. ruteri strains] probiotic yogurt … since it’s extremely important to AVOID ingesting glucose, we avoid ALL ultra-processed foods, eg snack foods or soft drinks, almost all processed foods, eg even minimizing things like tortillas and just generally shunning all carbohydrates as much as possibles, preferring to getting more calories from healthy fat, eg butter, avocados, and fat-burning through fasting, we generally want to stick closer to fast-mimicking diet and a fasting lifestyle that incorporates regular extended fasts with an intention of approaching an optimal, lower weight as we age.

### 1-9 Mental and Spiritual Sharpening / Prayer / Holy Hour Humility 

1. Holy Hour is the foundation of the entire time mgmt program … it starts at 4:00 AM and is entirely about getting one’s head straight for the day ahead … before we timeblock our day and plan our other priorities, we set aside other cares/concerns for one hour … after stretching and getting moving in the morning, perhaps taking care of some basic chores just to wake up, we relax and get more serious about our day … it’s about MINDFUL sharpening and throwing/shooting - focus solely on sharpness and targets …as we learn practically with knives, sharpening skills; hitting the target … we begin everything we do by rehearsing the entire process of what we plan to do … for just a minute or two before we get into the physical practice.

2. Prayer is the BEGINNING  - 30 m, center on Lord’s Prayer, adoration of 20 mysteries of Christ, it’s not about our wants or needs or worries; it’s about LISTENING to WILL of the Father, CONTEMPLATING the MYSTERIES of Jesus Christ and emptying our minds of noise, chatter, worries to be able to be a vessel capable of receiving guidance / blessings from the Holy Spirit.

3. Breath Control Exercise - throughout the day we will use opportunities to practice diaphragmatic breathing techniques, which are also about recentering our attention on the WILL of the Father … the general intent is institutionalizing the habit of slowing down the breath, to be still and know … in order to give us the background for these opportunistic sessions that will materialize randomly, we set aside a few minutes to think about what objectives we might focus on as opportunities arise

4. Breathwork Training / Investigation / Experimentation … during this period we might experiment or investigate our technique to vary approach in our exercises such as 4-7-8 Breathing or Box Breathing - 4 sets of 5 breaths (inhale, hold, exhale, hold for 4 ct each)


5. Gratitude Journaling … Emotional Successes, BIG WIN or just new opportunities for polishing/ improvement - we might note THE one big positive outcome from today's practice … but it might what FIRST excites you or gives you new hope, what WIN you want to build on

6: Examen Journaling … throughout the day will be about the FRUSTRATIONS and challenges - just express the angst; if you want discuss what’s not going so well or where the struggle is, but mostly just try to act like you belong … fake it till you make it … the Examen journal will be the basis your FRAILITY Index to measure improvement going forward

7. USING Examen/Self-Coach data … we review the previous days Examen journal to shape our future days … this journal is filled with screams of aw fuck kinds of angst …the examen journal is just frustration …  no filter, no review - we will reflect on what went well at the end of the day …the journal itself is only a raw braindump needs to be nothing more than rough scribbling of a note to self material/diagram or basic gist what needs improvement … we don’t waste time on this activity, eg it’s maybe only 3-5 minutes/day … the expression of reaction is only first thought, best thought stuff that will be transformed as we REVIEW our failures from the previous day.

8: Daily Goal Setting REVIEW … we start off with written SMART goals, but EACH DAY is about REVIEW AND REVISION with an eye to upping the ante on our written SMART goals, possibly devising new SMART goals and re-adjusting our action plans or roadmaps for completion as we review the braindump data, then articulate/revise SMART goals for better future progression toward adjusted objectives.

9: Measurables, FRAILITY index ... making it more concrete … quantifying progress, beyond just management goal-Assessment in the previous step - we want to rate our SMART goal progress in terms of measurables for things like defined accomplishments, eg passed certification exam, consistency of daily focus, patience with struggle, and defined progressions in technique on a scale of 1-10.

### 10-29. VISUALIZING a successful day

Timeblocking of day ahead starts with guided visualization of each planned block, before the day starts … this visualization that we do at the macro level is also something we will also do before each micro block throughout the day … it needn’t take long, 10+ seconds visualizing perfection of plan/technique in achieving the goal is enough.

10-19. There are thirty 30-minute timeblocks in a 15 hour day, from 4 AM until 7 PM. As a general rule ORDINARILY it’s important to only schedule about 5 hrs or 10 30-minute blocks of intense, peak flow work activity for each of the 6 work days … other time is needed for things like holy hour, time-blocking activity itself, journaling, reading, workouts, listening to audio books, meals, chores … but serious, peak-flow timeblock sketch is limited to 10 daily objectives … one atomistic, achievable objective for each 30 minute block … actually one 25 minute pomodoro with a 4 minute Tabata HIIT WOD … sketch out the day … WITH CHORES, BREAKS, WALKS, HOLY HOUR …; do a mental rehearsal of each of your 10 objectives … make sure you get the BIG DEAL done, which is item 11 on this list … but also make sure that you have the three-five next biggest things, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 on your daily agenda of things that you’d really like to put a dent in … have four or five more things, 17, 18, 19, 20, that would be nice to knock off the much larger overall to-do list … re-prioritize 11-20 during this sketch as you think through the mental rehearsal of different practical scenarios in your mind … ORDINARILY it’s enough to put a dent in 10 things each day for six days or 60 things per week … but IN EMERGENCIES, it might be necessarily to sort of just work FT without any breaks on particularly important tasks … it’s important to have about 60 objectives [things you’d maybe rather not do, unless you scheduled yourself] per week and in each case, JUST STAY AT IT for 25 minutes and focus solely on that objective and put as big a dent as you can in the task for 25 minutes [and then leave it for tomorrow and walk away from it or if you almost have it entirely finished, wrap it up].

21-29. Remember to amp up the vision in the timeblock by stretching, adding serious PRESSURE, but with emotional regulation, or giving yourself a 25-minute timelimit .. in other words after you have sketched the structure, bump the goal, stress the objectives of each block to PUSH yourself … you will need push yourself [and ratchet up the push] in order to practice staying calm under actual [rather than just your own simulated] time pressure; we look for ways to stretch or increase push to simulate pressure/disruptions … the discipline of adapting.

### 30 ... schedule time to RELAX … but not until AFTER Prayer, Goalsetting and Timeblocking

AFTER beginning the day correctly AT 4:00 AM, it’s essential [even in emergency, high pressure, full-court press situations] to take a few moments to just relax, but taper off any crutches. The point of relaxing at this point is to let your subconscious catch up and suggest what you might have forgotten, as you get ready mentally, laying foundation with great workout.

#### 161-168 Recovery, Cool,Stretching … Interruptions, Weather, Injuries

161-164 Recovery, Cool Down Stretching - take 3-5 minutes just to prevent injury … but develop a longer Mobility WOD to rehab injuries and rebuild youthful flexibility … consider a video review or biomechanics analysis - if/when possible/practical to watch your session for technique analysis [as skills progress], but don’t worry about this too much to start off with.

165-168. Interruptions, Weather, Injuries - Planning or scheduling rest days or planning ALT DAYs to allow a certain [low, eg 5-10] number of either light or disrupted sessions per month for recovery OR catching up on other things OR when bad weather prevents outside training OR other things in life generate unintended interruptions … to avoid becoming de-motivated when one can’t stick religiously to a schedule … shit happens, don’t get derailed by it, USE IT

### 168-200 Gracie 32 Principles … The DISCIPLINE of principles IS key to FREEDOM

If you want to become better, techniques are not really the entire answer … although it never hurts to look at technique videos … in order to develop your ability to coach yourself, you have to train and learn from the repetitions as you use the principles passed down by the best.

The apex principle of jiu-jitsu is Efficiency –  everything we do in jiu-jitsu aims to achieve maximum productivity with minimal effort by way of leverage, for maximum efficiency … in order to prevail in a match, a fighter will attempt to get his opponent to submit … thus, the first thing that we train ourselves to do is to NOT get into positions where we are vulnerable to submission. Efficiency is really about MINIMALISM … or renunciation of every kind of move or tactic or strategy that is more than we need because defending stupid shit or defending comfort/convenience is a ticket to rapid submission. Minimalism = Efficiency. Efficiency = Minimalism.

The two Macro Principles we rely on to optimize efficiency in every SITUATION are Timing and Control … obviously, therefore situational awareness is a matter of understanding what we really do have control over and when/what/how the situation can change in the next few moments of time so that we can improve our control … and ability to move toward submission OR, at minimum, toward escape and freedom from being under control.

By applying the Macro Principles of Timing and Control in unique, different proportions in different situations for accomplishing different specific combat objectives, the Gracies have identified the 32 “Micro Principles” which govern all of jiu-jitsu. We focus on studying each principle and then think about applying those principles in jiu-jitsu or different situations in life.

168 Principle 1: Connection
169 Principle 2: Detachment
170 Principle 3: Distance
171 Principle 4: Pyramid
172 Principle 5: Creation 
173 Principle 6: Acceptance 
174 Principle 7: Velocity 
175 Principle 8: Clock
176 Principle 9: River
177 Principle 10: Frame
178 Principle 11:Kuzushi
179 Principle 12: Reconnaissance
180 Principle 13: Prevention
181 Principle 14: Tension 
182 Principle 15: Fork
183 Principle 16: Posture
184 Principle 17: False Surrender
185 Principle 18: Depletion
186 Principle 19: Isolation
187 Principle 20: Sacrifice
188 Principle 21: Momentum 
189 Principle 22: Pivot 
190 Principle 23: Tagalong 
191 Principle 24: Overload
192 Principle 25: Anchor 
193 Principle 26: Ratchet 
194 Principle 27: Buoyancy 
195 Principle 28: Head Control
196 Principle 29: Redirection 
197 Principle 30: Mobility 
198 Principle 31: Centerline 
199 Principle 32: Grandmaster

200 Discipline is freedom … mastery is achieved through diligent repetition and continual REVIEW, adaptation and growth … as we know, jiu-jitsu consists of thousands of techniques; it’s easy to get intimidated or even lost in all of the different techniques or moves … nobody ever really fully masters the art … all are at different stages of mastery … that is why it’s important to remember that all of which are governed by a relatively small number of principles. Once you learn these macro principles not only will you become much more proficient in all the techniques that you’ve already learned thus far, but you will be more capable of picking up new techniques, innovating and improvising solutions in any situation for which you have not yet learned specific techniques. The key is discipline, diligence, repetition and REVIEW.

### 201-250 Self-Coaching Strategies: Structuring/Planning/Implementing Sessions

#### 201-210. Amping up the progressive variation

Gradually move back in distance with each successful shot, then progressively move in/out or right/left or up/down

#### 211-220. Amping up the angle Variation

Experiment with different shooting angles, right/left, uphill/downhill, prone/kneeling/standing

#### 221-230. Precision with Movement

Shoot while moving or from different positions; combine with angle variation.

#### 231-240. Speed and Reload Drills

Time how fast you can reload and shoot accurately; combine with changing positions and movement.

#### 241-250. Simulated Scenarios or Field Practice

Use realistic 3D, feet-on-the-ground scenarios and lifelike targets for a sense of the enemy. Add in distractifcations or randomizations; add noise/music or visual distractions.
