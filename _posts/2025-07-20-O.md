## O. Christlike Connections

Engaging in new projects, meeting new souls and building [and, in some cases, re-building] authentic friendships and family relationships marked by genuine love, empathy, and a shared commitment to Christ. This involves practicing active listening, offering encouragement and support, and demonstrating God's love through acts of service. It also means being transparent and vulnerable, sharing struggles and joys, and holding one another accountable in love. This intentional approach to acquaintances, friendships and closer relationships fosters an environment of belonging, acceptance, and spiritual growth.
