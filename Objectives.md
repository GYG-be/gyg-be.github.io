## A. Putting God First

*I am not under even the remotest of tiny illusions that I have done anything like adequate job of this,* which is why this objective is first and more prominent. 

This objective has to be THE priority that drives all othes. Prioritizing a deep understanding of God's will in every facet of life. This involves actively seeking His guidance through consistent and sincere prayer, studying and applying biblical wisdom, seeking counsel from mature Christians, and trusting the Holy Spirit's leading. This aligns decisions with scriptural principles and fosters a lifestyle that reflects obedience and love for God. It's important to recognize how this first objective drives all objectives and how how all other objectives are in support of this most primary of all primary objectives.

### B. Holiness as a lifestyle choice

Holiness is not found in a place, or a building or a group of individuals. **Holiness has to come from a PERSONAL choice of how to LIVE 86400 seconds/day.**

It starts with holy hour beginning every day and keeping the Sabbath holy in order to BEGIN every week. Holiness is not about resting, although we do try to devote the Sabbath to rest -- it's mostly about resurrection and spiritual renewal, looking forward not regretting the past or thinking that we've earned a few hours of laziness. Holiness as a lifestyle is aobut acknowledging each day's holy hour and each week's Sabbath as a sacred time ordained by God FOR RENEWAL. Renewal can include attending church services but is mostly about engaging in the personal worship of lifestyle, with time for solitude, reflection, and also fellowship. Holiness as a lifestyle involves incorporating regular spiritual disciplines throughout the week, as the default activity, ie rather than watching TV or scrolling through social media ... this means things like physical prayer, Bible study, and meditation, and everythint that is about maintain a consistent constant connection with God to manage or, if necessary, even ignore the ephemeral stresses of daily life.

### C. Servant Leadership

Serve first! Serve first to imitate and fully adore the mysteries of Christ's example of servant leadership. In this case, we can lead best by following Christ's example. Prioritize the needs of others and using personal influence to empower and uplift those around you. This involves actively seeking opportunities to serve in the church, community, and workplace, while demonstrating humility, compassion, and a genuine desire to help others grow and succeed. It also means fostering healthy relationships built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to serving God and others.

### D. Pushing For 10X-er Productivity

"10X-er" productivity is really about making OTHERS around oneself more productive, ie it's sort of like being a team player that coache the team to ALL ***become*** better, more productive team players with much higher expectations. Back in the dark ages [when Microsoft was developing Windows or Google was developing search engines], the 10X-er idea USED TO BE that some individual whiz could be 10 times more productive than others in a given area of life [*so companies wanted to hire that guy*] ... but that view of being a 10X-er is old, backward, inbred, antiquated thinking ... NOW, being a 10X-er is about being productive in one's own right, but also pushing and helping the entire team to step it up -- so that the entire team helps the productive person being more productive, especially in terms of team productivity. Team productivity in this 10X-er sinse is not some *nice*, trite, ["sing Kumbaya"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sing_Kumbaya) material -- this is about raising expectations for the team and expecting elite performance from everyone or sub-par players head to the sidelines and get into a different game they're better suited for. Pushing for 10X-er productivity really has to happen in all realms of one's life ... soul, mind, body ... and, if it weren't already obvious, the 10X-er thing is not just about me, but it's mainly for others *starting with me,* ***working on me***.

### Z. Using AI to Better Program Myself

*This is more of a META-objective, rather than an objective.*

I am using a wide variety of AI resources to generate deep thought provoking questions ... because I guess I am not particularly interested in using AI for code or regurgitating clever code snippets from all of the code libraries produced by humankind, and *somebody else is doing that.* So instead of something like SourceGraph [Code Intelligence](https://sourcegraph.com/code-search) or an AI-first IDE like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/blog) or Claude [Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), *which are great tools!* ... I am trying to program ME. 

The best way to do this is for me to THINK, and not to waste any time thinking about stupid shit.

Toward that end, I find that benefit from screenfuls of Questions ... that's why I ask for 100 Questions on various Objectives [for me to THINK about, not to answer but to ponder] ... the answers that come back are deep, essential, Classical questions that humans have been asking themselves for a few thousand years, at least ... so, instead of some version of *writers block* or just watching YouTube videos or recommended shorts and thinking about random stupid shit [which was ***active-measure-engineered*** to distract humans and make them stupid or hate-filled weaponized zombies]... I can get the questions [and ask more questions to request deeper questions about the questions] from AI resources, ie Claude, Grok, Gemini, Copilot, DeekSeek, et al.
