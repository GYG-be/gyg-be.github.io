                        <p><em>Never mind that humans should be taught at a very young age how to make themselves useful, enjoy being productive and, very importantly, negotiate their salary so that they get paid per negotiated contract for their useful efforts, ie THAT difficiency in parenting and educational systems is a topic for another manifesto. The ENTIRE process of educating humans and building educational systems, looking in the rear view mirror, for careers that existed five, ten, twenty-five or even fifty years ago is HOPELESSLY and PAINFULLY broken.</em></p>
<p><strong>We have to skip right past the backward looking education and jobsearch processes to get to what MUST be done</strong></p>
<p>This manifesto focuses on the <em>professional</em> and the <em>opportunity discovery process</em> and how we find work first and build our careers with education and professional development that is actually relevant in the digital age.</p>
<p>The digital labor market has fractured into a constellation of specialized silos.</p>
<p>To find temporary short-term work or gig labor, one turns to the location-specific taxonomies of TaskRabbit.</p>
<p>To secure high-value technical work, one must monitor the bidding wars of Upwork or the bounty boards of Gitcoin.</p>
<p>To find a co-founder, one navigates the "blind" dating mechanics of Y Combinator’s matching platform or the swipe-based interface of CoffeeSpace.</p>
<p>To network the whole thing together, we are supposed to use a creepy business-oriented social network like LinkedIn, which is evidently inspired by the elbow-rubbing techniques that the founder of LinkedIn learned on Jeffrey Epstein's island.</p>
<p>We all know already that finding work has traditionally been a matter of who you know, specifically who you've already worked with and who knows your capabilities ... but in the digital age, it is increasingly necessary to find new connections, to work with new colleagues, to build trust and establish credibility in new communities by doing work that demonstrates an ability to accomplish things and build trust in months rather than decades.</p>
<p>This fragmentation of the digital labor market imposes a severe cognitive tax on the professional, forcing the professional to act as a human router to optimize one's career progression, constantly switching contexts, normalizing data formats across different platforms, and manually executing repetitive outreach tasks.</p>
<p>Project GYG proposes a radical reconsideration, simplification and consolidation of this landscape through the development of the "Opportunity Finder"—an autonomous AI agent designed to act as a universal proxy for the user.</p>
<p>This system is not merely an aggregator; it is an open source collection of prompts and code starters necessary for building personalized agentic entities capable of semantic reasoning, autonomous negotiation, and cross-platform execution.</p>
<p>The objective is to invert the current "pull" model of opportunity discovery into a "push" model, where the agent continuously scouts, filters, and prepares opportunities for a simple binary decision by the human principal.</p>
<h1 id="gyg-project-architectural-vision"><a class="header" href="#gyg-project-architectural-vision">GYG Project Architectural Vision</a></h1>
<p>The following report details the exhaustive architectural vision in the form of a100-task execution plan required to build the GYG "push" model, in which user configured AI agents continuously scouts, filters, and prepares opportunities for a simple binary decision by the human principal.</p>
<p>The description of our plan attempts to dissect the technical, legal, and operational challenges of integrating disparate platforms—from the API-friendly ecosystem of Web3 bounties to the "walled gardens" of corporate job boards. The architecture leverages a multi-agent orchestration framework (CrewAI/LangGraph) supported by a robust data acquisition layer (Firecrawl, Apify) and a semantic reasoning core powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<h2 id="phase-1-strategic-reconnaissance-and-platform-deconstruction-tasks-115"><a class="header" href="#phase-1-strategic-reconnaissance-and-platform-deconstruction-tasks-115"><strong>Phase 1: Strategic Reconnaissance and Platform Deconstruction (Tasks 1–15)</strong></a></h2>
<p>The foundation of the Opportunity Finder lies in a deep, forensic understanding of the platforms it seeks to emulate and integrate. We cannot build a universal interface without first reverse-engineering the logic, data structures, and user flows of the target ecosystems. This phase focuses on dissecting the "Big Three" verticals: Co-founder Matching, Gig Economy, and Employment.</p>
<h3 id="11-co-founder-ecosystem-analysis-and-logic-cloning"><a class="header" href="#11-co-founder-ecosystem-analysis-and-logic-cloning"><strong>1.1 Co-Founder Ecosystem Analysis and Logic Cloning</strong></a></h3>
<p>The co-founder market is distinct from the job market; it is driven by "potential" rather than "track record," and "chemistry" rather than "skills." Platforms like Y Combinator (YC) Matching and CoffeeSpace have codified these intangible qualities into specific algorithmic interactions.<br />
<strong>Task 1: Reverse-Engineer YC Co-Founder Matching Attributes</strong> The YC Co-Founder Matching platform represents the gold standard for high-potential networking. Unlike standard job boards, it operates on a "double-blind" logic where interest must be mutual before identities are fully revealed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> By Week 2, produce a yc_scoring_model.json document that identifies 100% of the hidden weighting variables used in YC profiles (e.g., prestige markers, location rigidity) to inform the Agent’s internal scoring algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Execution:</strong> The agent must recognize that YC profiles prioritize "north star" metrics. Snippets indicate that profiles highlight specific prestige markers: "Harvard Law," "E7 at DoorDash," or "Y Combinator Alum". The agent must be trained to parse these non-standard credentials—identifying that "E7 at DoorDash" implies a specific level of engineering seniority equivalent to a CTO at a smaller startup.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Create a taxonomy of "Prestige Signals" extracted from 500 YC profiles to weight the agent's ranking logic.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Analyze the "blind" workflow to determine at what stage the agent can intervene. Since the platform requires an invite-accept-match cycle , the agent cannot simply "scrape contact info." It must be designed to manage the <em>state</em> of the connection request.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 2: Deconstruct CoffeeSpace’s Semantic Matching Engine</strong> CoffeeSpace differentiates itself by using a "swipe" mechanic similar to dating apps and an underlying semantic matching engine that looks beyond keywords.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Complete a comparative analysis of CoffeeSpace’s "swipe" logic vs. traditional search by Week 3, identifying three specific UX features to clone for the agent’s "Triage Mode."</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> CoffeeSpace’s value proposition is "mission alignment". The Opportunity Finder must not just match "Python" with "Python"; it must match "Decentralized AI" with "Privacy-First Architecture." The agent requires a "Mission Vector" in its database schema to replicate this.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Analyze CoffeeSpace’s onboarding questionnaire to recreate their psychometric profiling (e.g., risk tolerance, work style).</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Investigate the integration of Proxycurl by CoffeeSpace for automated LinkedIn enrichment. This feature is critical for reducing user onboarding friction and should be cloned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 3: Analyze Starthawk’s Search and Messaging Protocol</strong> Starthawk offers a more traditional directory-based search with direct messaging capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Map the Starthawk messaging API (or DOM structure) to enable the agent to autonomously draft and queue introduction messages.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Starthawk allows filtering by specific criteria like "has idea" vs. "no idea". This binary distinction is crucial for the agent to route opportunities correctly—a user looking to <em>join</em> a startup needs different matches than one looking to <em>found</em> one.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Define a "Readiness State" attribute in the Opportunity Schema based on Starthawk’s filters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 4: Establish Privacy and "Stealth Mode" Protocols</strong> Many users of co-founder platforms are currently employed and browsing in "stealth mode." The agent acts as a proxy, but its automated behavior must not de-anonymize the principal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Define a "Zero-Knowledge" interaction protocol by Week 3 that ensures no identifiable data is transmitted to third-party platforms during the scraping/querying phase.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Constraint:</strong> YC profiles are private to approved users. The agent must operate via an authenticated session that is strictly gated.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Implement a "Local-Only" processing rule where profile data is downloaded and analyzed locally, rather than sending candidate data to external LLM APIs without PII redaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-gig-economy-and-bounty-platform-analysis"><a class="header" href="#12-gig-economy-and-bounty-platform-analysis"><strong>1.2 Gig Economy and Bounty Platform Analysis</strong></a></h3>
<p>The gig economy presents a different challenge: high volume, low latency, and rigid categorization.<br />
<strong>Task 5: Map TaskRabbit and Dolly Service Taxonomies</strong> TaskRabbit and Dolly (focused on delivery) utilize strict categorical hierarchies. A user offering "labor" cannot simply be listed; they must be listed under "Heavy Lifting," "Assembly," or "Moving."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Create a unified GigCategory ontology that maps 100% of TaskRabbit skills and Dolly vehicle types to a standardized internal format.</li>
<li><strong>Research Insight:</strong> Dolly requires specific vehicle attributes (Pickup, Box Truck). The agent needs to know the user's asset inventory (e.g., "Do you own a truck?") to unlock these opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Scrape the full category trees of both platforms to build a translation layer (e.g., "I have a drill" -&gt; TaskRabbit "Mounting &amp; Installation").</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 6: Deconstruct Upwork’s Bidding and "Connects" Economy</strong> Upwork gamifies the proposal process with "Connects" (a virtual currency required to apply). Indiscriminate auto-applying will drain the user's budget instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Develop a "Return on Connects" (RoC) scoring model that predicts the probability of a reply before the agent spends credits.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Speed is a factor, but "proposal relevance" is higher. The agent must be capable of parsing the job description and answering specific screening questions, which are common on Upwork.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Analyze 100 successful Upwork proposals to identify common structural elements (e.g., "Restating the problem in the first sentence").</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 7: Scout Web3 Bounty Ecosystems (Gitcoin &amp; Immunefi)</strong> For technical users, the highest value "gigs" are often bug bounties or development grants on platforms like Gitcoin and Immunefi. These operate on radically different mechanics—often permissionless and result-based.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Integrate the Gitcoin Allo Protocol data structure into the agent’s scouting radar by Week 4.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Context:</strong> Gitcoin uses the Allo Protocol for capital allocation. The agent can query indexers or the blockchain directly to find active grant rounds, bypassing the need for UI scraping.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Map Immunefi’s severity scales (Critical, High, Medium) to dollar value estimates to normalize them against hourly freelance rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-job-market-and-niche-platform-analysis"><a class="header" href="#13-job-market-and-niche-platform-analysis"><strong>1.3 Job Market and Niche Platform Analysis</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Task 8: Analyze "Hidden" Job Markets (Pallet, Community Boards)</strong> High-quality startup roles often appear on curated boards like Pallet or in private Slack/Discord communities before hitting Indeed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Identify and catalog the top 50 niche Pallet boards and community servers relevant to the user's domain.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Pallet boards are community-specific (e.g., "Bankless Jobs"). The agent needs a "Community Discovery" module to find these fragmented URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Evaluate the feasibility of scraping Pallet, which uses a specific infrastructure distinct from standard ATSs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 9: Assess Technical Limitations of Major Job Boards (LinkedIn, Indeed)</strong> The major platforms are hostile to automation. Official APIs are generally restricted to enterprise partners.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Determine the "Safe Operating Limits" for scraping LinkedIn and Indeed to avoid account bans.</li>
<li><strong>Research Insight:</strong> PhantomBuster suggests a limit of ~80 profiles/day for LinkedIn scraping. The agent must enforce strict rate-limiting logic.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Evaluate the Indeed Job Sync API documentation to see if "Read-Only" access is possible for personal use (unlikely, necessitating scraping).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 10: Define the Unified "Opportunity Schema"</strong> To allow the user to compare a $50k bounty, a $150k job, and a co-founder role with 50% equity, the data must be normalized.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Draft the JSON schema for the UniversalOpportunity object, covering 95% of fields across all target platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Schema Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>type:</li>
<li>compensation_type:</li>
<li>risk_profile: [Low, Medium, High] (Derived from platform/stage)</li>
<li>remote_policy:</li>
<li>source_metadata: {...platform_specific_fields }</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 11: User Intake Strategy (SMART Goal Conversion)</strong> Users rarely state their goals clearly. "I want a better job" is not actionable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Design an onboarding interaction that forces the user to define constraints (e.g., "Min $120k," "Max 30 min commute").</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Create a "Trade-off Slider" UI (e.g., Equity vs. Salary) to weigh the matching algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 12: Compliance and Legal Framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Establish a legal compliance matrix for the agent’s operation.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Context:</strong> While scraping public data is generally protected (<em>HiQ vs LinkedIn</em>), scraping behind a login (like YC Matching) violates Terms of Service. The agent must be configurable to "Obey TOS" (restrictive) or "User Discretion" (permissive).</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Implement robots.txt parsing as a default setting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 13: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Architecture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Define the intervention points where the agent <em>must</em> pause for approval.</li>
<li><strong>Design Principle:</strong> No message is sent and no application is submitted without explicit user sign-off.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Design the notification payload for HITL requests (e.g., "Draft Application Ready. Review?").</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 14: Select Agentic Framework (CrewAI vs. LangGraph)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Finalize the orchestration stack.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Use <strong>CrewAI</strong> for the high-level collaboration between "Scout" and "Analyst" agents due to its role-based architecture. Use <strong>LangGraph</strong> for the specific, complex state machines required for form-filling and multi-step application processes, as it offers finer control over loops and retries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 15: Infrastructure Blueprint</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Produce a high-level system architecture diagram.</li>
<li><strong>Components:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Ingestion:</em> Firecrawl, Apify.</li>
<li><em>Storage:</em> Vector DB (Weaviate), Relational DB (Postgres).</li>
<li><em>Compute:</em> Docker Containers on AWS Fargate.</li>
<li><em>Interface:</em> Next.js Dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "senses" of the agent. This phase focuses on building the pipelines that ingest raw data from the web and convert it into the structured UniversalOpportunity schema defined in Phase 1. Given the diversity of sources, a "one size fits all" scraper is impossible. We will implement a tiered acquisition strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>The agent uses the "Map" feature of Firecrawl to find sub-pages (e.g., /careers/engineering).</li>
<li>It uses the "Scrape" feature to extract the content as Markdown.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Configure concurrency limits to avoid overwhelming target servers (Ethical Scraping).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 17: Implement Apify Actors for "Hard Targets"</strong> Platforms like LinkedIn and Wellfound use sophisticated anti-bot measures (fingerprinting, CAPTCHAs). Building custom scrapers for these is a maintenance nightmare.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Integrate Apify’s specialized actors for LinkedIn, Wellfound, and Glassdoor.</li>
<li><strong>Wellfound Strategy:</strong> Use the radeance/wellfound-job-listings-scraper which handles the complex pagination and infinite scroll of Wellfound’s React application.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn Strategy:</strong> Use linkedin-jobs-scraper via Apify. Note the limitation: LinkedIn scrapers often require a valid session cookie. The agent must include a secure vault to store and rotate these cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Set up a webhook listener to receive data from Apify actors asynchronously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 18: Develop Headless Browser Agents (Playwright) for SPAs</strong> Some platforms, particularly YC Matching, act as Single Page Applications (SPAs) where data is loaded dynamically after user interaction (clicks).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Build a Playwright-based agent to navigate the YC Co-Founder Matching portal.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The agent launches a browser context with storageState injected (pre-authenticated cookies).</li>
<li>It simulates human-like mouse movements to avoid bot detection.</li>
<li>It intercepts network responses (XHR/Fetch) to capture the JSON data payloads directly, rather than parsing the DOM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 19: Integrate Exa.ai for Semantic Discovery</strong> Keyword search is insufficient. A user looking for "companies building AI agents" might miss a company that describes itself as "automating workflows with LLMs."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Integrate Exa.ai (formerly Metaphor) to enable embedding-based search for company discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Exa allows the agent to search for "link similar to this one," enabling it to expand a seed list of interesting companies into a broader market map.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Implement a nightly "Discovery Routine" that queries Exa for new domains matching the user's interest vector.</li>

<p><strong>Task 20: Upwork API and RSS Hybrid Strategy</strong> Upwork’s API is restrictive. However, they provide RSS feeds for specific search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Implement a polling engine that checks Upwork RSS feeds every 15 minutes for new gigs.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Use the Upwork API (if access granted) only for the "Apply" phase to conserve rate limits. Use RSS for the "Discovery" phase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 21: Web3 Data Ingestion (Allo Protocol &amp; Immunefi)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Build an indexer for the Gitcoin Allo Protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> The Allo Protocol emits events on-chain when new pools are created. The agent can listen to these events or query a subgraph (The Graph) to detect new grant rounds instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Task:</strong> Scrape Immunefi’s bounty list JSON (often exposed in their frontend app bundle) to get real-time bounty data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 22: TaskRabbit and Dolly Location Monitoring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMART Objective:</strong> Build a location-aware scraper for local gigs.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>TaskRabbit shows different tasks based on Zip Code. The agent must iterate through the user's target zip codes.</li>
<li>For Dolly, the agent simulates a "Get Quote" request to see availability and pricing in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
