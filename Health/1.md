## 1st WHY -- Maintain or Improve Spiritual Health

The only form of health that actually really matters is spiritual health ... get this one right and the all the others have a better chance of following ... but without DEEP spiritual health ... *So what! Who gives a FUCK? It just ain't gonna matter, since*...**spiritual health is the only form of health one really NEEDS.**

I trying hard to be more focused upon what I am commanded to do as a Christian.  Christ laid out the ENTIRE SET OF REQUIREMENTS for what we must do as Christians in just four verses ... but if you can only remember one verse, ***if you get the first one right, the other three WILL follow; that's guaranteed!***

* [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-37-compare.html): You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

* [Matthew 22:38](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-38-compare.html): This is the first and greatest commandment. *{HINT: Focus on this one first and foremost. Yes, it will help you when you struggle with the second one; but it's the most important one. Do not blow this one. As Christians, we believe that the only path to God the Father is through Christ the Son.}*

* [Matthew 22:39](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-39-compare.html): And the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

* [Matthew 22:40](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/22-40-compare.html): On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. EVERTYTHING ELSE in scripture is is just commentary on these two commandments; don't complicate Christianity.

The two commandments in these four verses are matters most in my Spiritual Health ... I need to continually be in prayer or reminding myself of these commandments.

To the extent that I have any extra time here, I am trying focus on studying mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR), ie RESPONDING to stress [by deconstructing it and getting to root cause, to paralyze the bad habits of being myself], rather than reacting to it [and thus giving in to the bad habits of being myself]. 

In that same MBSR vein, I also work on different open source development communities and try to study asynchronous workflows and creative interactions in those communities, so that we might learn to, as [pragmatic technologists](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1713930459779129358), better RESPOND to situations in the world, RATHER than hyperbloviating about the next big thing OR trying to sell some new venture or new product OR simply go through life, being captive of the programming and propaganda we are bombarded with [in the Information Age], as we generally rush to judge and REACT to things in the world.
