# Health is the ONLY wealth. The only health that really matters is the health of the soul.

I am healthy *BECAUSE* I avoid **ROUTINE** medical care and pharmaceuticals ... my time mgmt regime is a matter of RESPONDING to things in the world, RATHER THAN reacting to things as one is programmed and propagandized to react.


## Six Pillars of Health

The Six Pillars of Health drive my allocation of time/energy/focus:

1) 50% of my energy/focus/time or 56 hours/week is allocated to [spiritual health](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Spiritual/)

2) 25% of my energy/focus/time or 28 hours/week goes to [emotional health](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Emotional/)

3) 12.5% of my energy/focus/time or 14 hours/week goes to [exercise](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Exercise/)

4) 6.25% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week goes to [nutrition](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Nutrition/)

5) 3.125% of my energy/focus/time or 30 minutes/day is devoted to [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Sleep/). This is nothing little housekeeping things like making my bed and everything I do beforehand to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping

6) 3.125% of my energy/focus/time or 30 minutes/day is devoted to [supplementation](https://markbruns.github.io/Health/Supplements/), optimizing biochemistry, getting the right amount of sunlight, and miscellaneous other things that are not covered by the other five pillars of health

## Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction and The Resurrection of Christ

Mindfullness based stress reduction DRIVES my 86400.guru time management venture; OPTIMIZING each second of the day is entirely about RESPONDING to the world, RATHER THAN reacting to the world as one is programmed and propagandized to ***react*** ... REACTIONS are always driven by pathological [in a spiritual sense] manipulations of priorities. This means that [my life is DRIVEN by the Resurrection of Christ!](https://markbruns.github.io/template/2024/03/31/He-is-risen.html)

I avoid emotional games, such as selling games or any kind of thing where I being to do something because of someone's propaganda or programming. I walk away from any sort of manipulation that is based on fear or desire or wealth or power or celebrity or any sort of emotional trigger. I particularly detest any sorts of argument that places a higher value on human baggage or material junk RATHER than prioritizing one's spirtual life. [**My life is DRIVEN by the Resurrection of Christ!**](https://markbruns.github.io/template/2024/03/31/He-is-risen.html).

In addition to time management, I also work on different open source development communities and try to study asynchronous workflows and creative interactions in those communities, so that we might learn to, as [pragmatic technologists](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1713930459779129358), better RESPOND to situations in the world, RATHER than hyperbloviating about the next big thing OR trying to sell some new venture or new product OR simply go through life, being captive of the programming and propaganda we are bombarded with [in the Information Age], as we generally rush to judge and REACT to things in the world.
