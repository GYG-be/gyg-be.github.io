## 7TH WHY -- TIME MANAGEMENT health is really part of the higher priority WHYs above

But TIME MANAGEMENT needs to be integrated into every day.

0) STOP trying to look busy, stay busy or keep yourself busy ... running around like a BUSY chicken with your head cut off is how you will WRECK your life ... remember Mark 8:36 AND also remember to let the dead bury their dead, you don't need to attend everyone's funeral or respond to everyone's urgency -- you certainly don't need to create your own bullshit urgencies.

1) Get up at 4:00 AM ... strictly for Holy Hour. **There is no higher priority in your day than Holy Hour.** After Holy Hour, if you feel exhausted, maybe you're sick so just go back to bed and sleep till noon if that's what it takes ... but it's probably better on most days to review your calendar and emails ... this assumes that you have timeblocked all 15 hours of wakefulness into 30 into blocks -- each 25 minutes long, with a 4 minute HIIT Tabata set of drills/exercises and before/after 30s regroups ... specifying those is optional, just be sure to get at least 30 minutes of Zone 2 exercise throughout the day.

2) Write down ONE Big Deal that absolutely has to be done today, in order for the day to not be a total waste ... WRITE IT DOWN in sufficient detail, so that you know exactly what you meant by *getting it done* ... get that ONE big deal done, at all costs ... try to do it first, but often it might depend on some other schedule ... if it's a longer project that you are dreading, then AT MINIMUM, at least give it all you have for one 25-minute pomodoro to put a dent in finishing it; after you've done one 25-minute dent, try to do the second/third/fourth/fifth, if it's really detestable. 

4) Write down three-to-five more high priority things that really sorta needs be done today ... if it doesn't NEED to be done, do not write it down ... do NOT write shit down just to have a bigger list ... three more high priority things is plenty ... it's better to just knock off ONE more high priority WIN in addition to the BIG DEAL, rather than wasting time coming up with a 30-bullet bullet-pointed list so that you can feel good about crossing stuff off ... the most important aspect of time mgmt is to get the important stuff done ... it's not important to stay busy, to look busy or get excited about a long to-do list ... just do what matters most.

5) ATTEND your appointments in your calendar ... even those *maybe* webinars that you agreed to try to attend, if at all possible ... or, else if you kinda know you won't attend or are not likely to attend, then stop putting that shit in your calendar ... if you say that there's no maybe, that you're definitely going to attend, SHOW the F up AND HAVE YOUR SHIT IN A GROUP PREPARED BEFORE you show up!  Attending your appointments, honoring your commitments, checking your email ONCE is why you check your calendar and your emails right after Holy Hour ... and then, you can get on with your day, get your ONE Big Deal done ... and feel good about the day.

6) Regardless of what a disaster the day might have been, you can't fix it after sunset, so get the F to bed immediately after watching the sun set. There's absolutely NOTHING that deserves any of your time after sunset ... get to bed *early* so that you can get up at 4:00 for Holy Hour. As you reflect on your day, remember that tomorrow will here soon enough, but that **there cannot possibly be a higher priority in your day than Holy Hour.**


### Steal good lifehacks and time mgmt ideas ... but don't copy everybody's bullshit

So far, this page is only about my collection of boilerplate schedules ... for daily rituals that I fall back upon when I have the five big things of the day complete.

My actual calendars [for different ventures as well as my personal life] are in constant flux and not something I share publicly, although I sometimes share calendars with those who need that kind of access. 

My daily routines and timeblocking is actually really tedious and predictable ... it's not really that interesting and I have learned that most of the time I am probably failing to stick with the schedule -- but one needs a boilerplate plan to work back toward, even though one knows that the boilerplate schedule is never going to be kept.

The point of my ***Daily Routines*** (see below) is that I *just* work on **daily disciplines** automatically, without even thinkng about putting these things on my calendar or ToDo list:

* **Prayers and meditation to "Be STILL and KNOW"** (ChristianMBSR) ... different passages speak to this, but [Psalms 46](https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/46.html) is one of the most comforting examples.

* **Exercises to cultivate gratitude** ... there's no shortage of reasons to be optimistic or examples of things to be grateful for ... we know this from passages such as [Philippians 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8-compare.html), but as Pope John Paul II reminded us,that truth will never contradict truth; [by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_fides-et-ratio.html).

* **Functional physical fitness like walking or doing chores and simple body weight calesthinics** is a matter of stewardship and not letting our bodies or minds atrophy ... physical activity makes us healthier than extra food. Athough physical fitness necessary for maintaining intellectual and emotional fitness, as we know from  ... [1 Timothy 4:8](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-timothy/4-8-compare.html), our real objective in leading a more disciplined life to glorify God the Father and our Savior Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit is all about sustaining fitness and our ability to celebrate our blessings both today and forever.

* **Mental exercises to listen more actively and communicate more effectively** ... as we know from passages like [James 1:19](https://www.biblestudytools.com/james/1-19-compare.html), is that we must first seek to understand before we can act. Nobody ever cares about how much we know or what our agenda is until well after they can see our agenda is about how much we care about the health and well-being of others.

# Weekly Boilerplate Schedule

**The point of my weekly boilerplate schedule is to have a Weekly Routine**, *just like a Daily Routine*, so that I never have to struggle that much to come up what kind of thing should the ***main*** item for today is [in addition to the daily discipline exercises]. A weekly routine makes it EASIER to focus on things that I add to my calendar or ToDo [as soon as I can get around to it] list. Daily and weekly routines make it MUCH EASIER to be present, settled and able to RESPOND to emergencies that arise.

The BIG reason for having daily and weekly routines ... to spell things out, ***rather than*** just filling up time with random scrolling or idleness ... is to make easier to make entries in our Examen Journal, which is our approach for daily reflection on those times when we lost focus, started to become depressed, anxious or overwhelmed or when we were felling burnt out or doubting our purpose or goals.  

## SUNDAY -- Strategic planning to build gratitude discipline every day of the week

**The whole point of the Examen practice and reviewing our Examen Journal is about spiritual growth, spiritual fitness and meditation and prayer** ... which is intended to complement our gratitude discipline.

**GRATITUDE JOURNALING is JOY!!!**

Joy ... thinking about Jesus, others and you ... J.O.Y. in that order of priority is about DEEPENING our spiritual health!**

SUNDAY is a day of rest and more focus on spiritual contemplation of JOY ... because, on a *tactical* basis throughout the week, we want to start each day's journal entry with "I am grateful for: ____" ... and then, on Sunday, we can go back and review the entries, as we think more *strategically* about where our FRAILITIES are and how we can work on things to be more grateful in a well-rounded, overall sense each day.

On Sunday, we generally want to focus more of our energy on the strategic planning for the week ahead ... the point of planning or sketching out an outline is to **develop the the outline of how/where we will try harder to do that one EXTRA concrete thing for each day of the upcoming week** to ENSURE that we are always cultivating a well-rounded mindset of gratitude.

We still have to FIND that one EXTRA concrete thing each day ... but on Sunday, we think about where we should look each day.

It's NOT just a routine kind of thing that you would not ordinarily just do without thinking about it. 

This is STRATEGIC ... it's strategic thinking about how/where we will focus our tactical thinking to FIND something that helps us make being more grateful more CONCRETE.

The point is improve the discipline of WORKING AT **BETTER** CULTIVATING AN OPTIMISTIC MINDSET OF GRATITUDE. We don't want this to be accidental or haphazard; we want to TRY to be more intentional about our gratitude. **GRATITUDE is about DEEPENING our spiritual health!**

**Make it a daily objective to notice and point out at least one special thing that is especially noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy** ... perhaps some young sales phenom like [Alex Hormozi](https://www.facebook.com/ahormozi) ... or the wrestling spladle and Brook Hardy ... and, **ALSO make it a point of pointing that excellence out or sharing your admiration with others.** *"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable -- if anything is excellent or praiseworthy -- DWELL ON such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me -- PUT IT INTO PRACTICE. And the God of peace will be with you."*  [Philippians 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8-compare.html)

## MONDAY -- body weight calisthenics and Plyometrics / Striking / Hitting / Kicking / Jumping

### Morning Kick Off -- Start Monday right.

Early on Monday, start the week off with body weight calesthinics; these are intended to be done to warm-up every day, but be especially sure to get Monday's warm-up workout in.

Do each rep carefully and PROPERLY ... USE the mats, use the floor, use the ground ... use body weight ... get up and down off the ground/floor more ... use every excuse to work in a few alternate burpees, pushups, sit-ups, squats, burpees, pushups, sit-ups, squats ... do more rolling/crabwalking/shrimpting drills on the mats ... freeform exploration like a little kid or [Feldenkrais Method (FM)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9657136/) is a technique aiming at increasing personal self-knowledge through conscious movements ... FM has been labeled by detractors as "glorified yoga" or as medical treatment, something that "borders on quackery" ... but conscious focus through slow movement especially helps elderly people. Specifically, FM improves mobility, balance and quality of life. For people with chronic low back pain, FM has similar benefits such as back school lessons or core stability exercises; in people with cervical pain, FM may be more adequate than conventional physical therapy. For people with neurodegenerative diseases, FM is effective in improving balance.

### Monday Main Event -- Plyometrics / Striking / Hitting / Kicking / Jumping

We will be developing 31 day syllabus for EACH day of the month exploring [the top 20 Plyometrics For Speed, Power and Performance](https://drjohnrusin.com/top-20-plyometrics-for-speed-power-and-performance/) ... use [plyometrics, such as hitting the heavy bag, to boost dynorphin release to get going in the morning or warming-up for the day](https://gemini.google.com/share/5da4eff9a61c) ... get going with [shadowboxing](https://totalshape.com/fitness/jon-jones-workout-diet/#Shadow%20Boxing), [heavy bag](https://www.amazon.com/Fighters-Guide-Hard-Core-Heavy-Training-ebook/dp/B07BH3WRL9), [speed drills](https://www.amazon.com/FAST-HANDS-Uniting-Physical-Maximize-ebook/dp/B0BHXG7SCR), [solo workouts](https://www.amazon.com/Solo-Training-3-50-Older-ebook/dp/B0150QXWLW), footwork drills

## Saturday -- Sambo Hybrid Jiujitsu Training

In a 31-module syllabus ... with drills / workouts for each day of those 31 days ... incorporate Rickson Gracie's Academy approach as well as Ryron/Renner Gracie's 32 principles to adapt Khabib Nurmagomedov's [Sambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)) [hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_martial_arts) training routine ... it's all about merging the most effective techniques of other martial arts, while avoiding most of the expensive gear or more sophisticated gym/dojo/exercise equipment. It's not JUST that the training happens in the remote parts of Dagestan allows Khabib to minimize distractions, connect with nature, immerse himself in wrestling culture, and strengthen his mental resilience ... it's ALSO that the spartaan [Sambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)) [hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_martial_arts) is focused on [***smeshing*** the opponent](https://bjjfanatics.com/collections/new-releases/products/sambo-the-top-game-a-blue-print-for-smeshing-by-khabib-nurmagomedov), completely closing distance and taking the opponent's ability to counter away.   His training approach is characterized by the following key elements:

9.1 **Emphasis on grappling, but also on grappling heritage**: Growing up in Dagestan, a region with a strong wrestling tradition and what many view as Spartan-like living conditions as the cultural norm, Khabib has honed his skills from a young age to avoid fame and idolatry, but instead focus on wrestling, grappling, and ground fighting, with a large supply of more than willing, qualified, tested training partners who value the experience.

9.2 **Spartan, ultra-simple, body-weight-driven training methods**: The point of the quaint, rustic, extremely ascetic exercises, such as running in the mountains or swimming in cold rivers, is extremely CONVENTIONAL in the old-school sense of forging mental toughness, building endurance, and stretching the limits of adaptability. There's no shortcut for this and more expensive, complicated equipment that's likely to break down and nicer dojos that have to stay looking immaculate actually get in the way. It's fine if you want to maintain gear and facilities, but using the body as weight and pushing through pain and discomfort in a [measured, but hormetic fashion](https://g.co/gemini/share/839dee068319) is necessary for improving focus, discipline, and mental resilience.

9.3 **High-altitude training:** Dagestan's mountainous terrain provides an ideal environment for high-altitude training; there some substitutes such as [breathwork and breath-holding](https://g.co/gemini/share/9a1077b32e26), none those really match being immersed for 24 hours as one trains at higher elevations to help improve cardiovascular endurance and oxygen efficiency. The inescapability of high-altitude conditions on top of the spartan lifestyle in remote Dagestan helps athletes better cultivate mental resilience, self-discipline, and a strong work ethic than similar spartan training at lower altitudes.

9.4 **Strong sense of community**: Training in Dagestan surrounds Khabib with a close-knit community of fellow wrestlers and fighters who share his dedication and work ethic. This supportive environment fosters a sense of camaraderie and pushes him to excel. Training in Dagestan allows Khabib to immerse himself in the region's rich wrestling tradition, constantly exposing him to high-level grapplers and wrestlers.

## Saturday Evening OR Sunday -- Meditation, Movement, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Worksession

*Take a view from the balcony* ... reflect on the past week's stressful situations

Stop catastrophizing, stop being hyper-aroused, stop knee-jerk REACTING to stress ... instead, learn to RESPOND to stress and address the root cause of what is driving stress. MBSR's efficacy as described in[Jon Kabat-Zinn's **Full Catastrophe Living**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Catastrophe_Living) is really driven by an intensely analytic view driving the deconstruction of we are experiencing.  The title should be understood in the context of the Zorba the Greek quote "*Am I not a man? Of course I've been married. Wife, house, kids ... YES ... the* ***full catastrophe!***" ... the book is nice read, but it's about the **full catastrophe** of normal, average, ordinary LIFE, not just the exceptional, newsworthy catastrophes that we think of as catastrophes, but *those* catastrophes usually almost never affect us as directly as ordinary stress of *just* living, growing older and experiencing loss. Do not REACT to stress; instead, RESPOND to stress by journaling, meditating, and going for long brisk walks to THINK ... if you know your way around your doctor's office, but have not speedwalked in the last 24 hours, you're doing it wrong.

On Saturdays, I will look at the week's progress in the past week's progress on the 31-day month long syllabus for a meditation, movement [mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction). 

The point of the Saturday MBSR worksession is to LEARN to repsond to opporunities in 31-day syllabus and possibly adjust and refactor ... the real point of MBSR is to be INTELLECTUALLY independent rather than going through motions and simply reacting to circumstandces  ... we want to use this workshop as an opportunity to learn to FORGIVE and let go of the bullshit  ... as we do these daily modules, we might meditatively speedwalk / hike, not just with a weighted pack, but with FOCUS ... in order to THINK, focus on breathwork and to just be more immersed in your LOCAL environment, ie rather than shops or bars/restaurants or doctor's offices ... practically, we want to USE walks to see what's going on in the community; this community awareness is PART of a wholistic [mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction) program driven by serendipitously-driven awareness of what is going on.

## Why Routine Even Matters

I sorta need to have a weekly ROUTINE that I *just do* without giving too much thought, BUT I still need to have my routine schedule of what I am going to be thinking about on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday ... because, for reasons I don't really understand [because it shouldn't really matter], but a weekly routine helps me to be in touch with *the working man* and maybe the world around me.


*{NOTE: Each day is an exercise workout or worksession that I focus on for that day. I DEEPLY, PASSIONATELY, ABSOLUTELY HATE EXERCISE, but I gotta do it ... I especially exercise equipment or any kind of gear which has no purpose other than for exercise, BUT I need to have a routine ...I especially hate going to special places, like gyms or dojos, to exercise with people who go to a special places to exercise. But, I do get that I need to work on my discipline of exercising every day ... so I try to work smarter or engineer higher productivity in it; I try to THINK about what I'm doing and WHY I need to be doing it. But there's no getting away from the fact that I am always going to DEEPLY, PASSIONATELY, ABSOLUTELY HATE EXERCISE}*.


## Futher Reading

1) Train in the preliminaries of AI and LLM models. You WILL HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF make the extra effort to continually be exploring and adding new things to explore ... periodically, use AI to brainstorm lists of 200 things to explore as you focus on a topic and then weed out the chaff [since most of the AI responses will be stuff that you've thought before]

2) [Stretching, warmup movement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C54FYGJ4) ...[Ido Portal](https://www.youtube.com/@portaldo/videos) [Developing Suppleness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=254_pqoRi1E) [Developing Legs Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abyTdOnauko) ... [Strength Side -- Movement as a catalyst for physical and mental transformation.](https://www.youtube.com/@Strengthside/videos) ...[Animal Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@AnimalFlow/videos) ... [Primal Movement](https://www.youtube.com/@primalmovement/videos) beyond general flexibility and rehab exercises, to [Ido Movement for Culture (IMC)](http://imcjournal.com/index.php/en/home) ... not just about physicality; it encompasses philosophy, tradition, and interdisciplinary research, particularly within the context of martial arts.

3) [Stability ball or balance](https://g.co/gemini/share/a3096d44f472)

4) [Resistance bands](https://g.co/gemini/share/ef823653436d)

5) Develop a 31-module syllabus in the realm of [body weight calisthenics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B11Y92J) or controlled body movement exercises ... this is different than other ways to use what you have around you or activities like your daily chores or your walk to the store as a workout, but you should be more BODY-AWARE in those things as you do them.

6) Develop a 31-module syllabus in the realm of endocrinology, including things like [suana](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7zTxRtr_ayM) and triggering release of [dynorphin](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/9d8318c33e34158dfbbc9772c5dcbe90fe24779d/Dynorphin%2C-Dysphoria%2C-and-Dependence%3A-the-Stress-of-Addiction/graph)

7) For supplements, develop a 31-module syllabus in things like [dosimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry) but especially in [hormetic response training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJNYn3LXSxQ) ... such as galatamine(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35310033/) and [traditional chinese medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27589716/)

8) Avail yourself of Kindle Unlimited, YouTube vids, online fora ... and all kinds of opportunities to not just learn about new workouts / drills and ***DO THEM***, but also to comment / email / LinkedIn connect with the author ... to let them know that you APPRECIATE their work ... MAKE IT A POINT TO NOTICE AND APPRECIATE the work of others AUTHORS each day. [Philippians 4:8-9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8-compare.html)


9) Develop a 31-module syllabus in therapeutic gardening, regenerative permaculture, soil building  

10) Develop a 31-module syllabus in hospice, palliative care and grieving/loss exercises ... LOSS is part of physical, mental, emotional life ... **we will ALL lose EVERY LAST PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL THING that we think we have** ... although, we as Christians believe in the Resurrection of Christ, we should realize the important point, that Christ, as a spiritual being, was the SAME as before He was crucified, He was NOT AT ALL the same in any physical, mental, emotional sense EXCEPT that He was *there* to reinforce the lesson one last time to his disciples.
